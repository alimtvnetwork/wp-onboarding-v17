# Clean Artifacts and Git History

Enforces repository cleanliness and guards against accidental commit of generated files.

## Actions

- Clean pycache, build artifacts, test logs, coverage dumps.
- Run `python 03-ai-scripts/19-artifact-remover.py`.
- **Zero Actions Storage & Remote Artifact Purge:** Enforce zero `actions/upload-artifact` in CI workflows. When GitHub Actions storage approaches quota, purge obsolete remote artifacts using `python 03-ai-scripts/34-purge-github-actions-artifacts.py --repo <repo-slug>` or trigger `.github/workflows/purge-actions-artifacts.yml`.
- Ensure `.gitignore` rules cover all newly introduced intermediate files.
- **Consolidated Atomic Commits:** NEVER make piecemeal 1-2 file commits. Commit all modified files and plans together as a single atomic unit.
- **Immediate Git Push:** ALWAYS push immediately to GitHub (`git push origin <branch>`) after creating any commit.
- **No Routine Builds:** NEVER execute full builds (`npm run build`, `go build ./...`) or `06-cicd-local-runner.py` during routine cleanup.
