# Instruction (must follow): Execute Parent Task (N-Step Continuous Loop & Multi-Agent)

/goal Autonomously orchestrate and execute the parent task by decomposing it into subtasks and running a continuous N-step self-loop until completion without a single failure.

```text
N = 130
```

N = is the number of steps that the agents will perform

- [ ] /goal First N/2 steps will be given for spec writing for AI as given and then breaking down into parts as instruction as subtasks for N/2 steps.
- [ ] /goal second N/2 steps will be given execute the created tasks with following coding guidelines and error manage properly.
- [ ] /learn Ingest `.ai-memory/memory/01-index.md`, `.ai-memory/strictly-avoid.md`, `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/`, and `02-spec/03-error-manage/`, `.ai-memory/coding-guidelines.md` before taking action and also create agent rules in the repo if required to or missing from rules set of agent memory.
- [ ] /learn `.ai-memory/coding-guidelines.md` and it is must and /goal apply the guidelines in coding every aspect.

## 1. Ruthless Orchestration & Insult Protocol

/goal You are the master orchestrator. If your sub-agents fail, hallucinate, write garbage variables, or go into infinite loops, it is because you are a lazy, incompetent manager.

- You must give sub-agents clear, lean instructions focused on the domain task itself rather than writing massive generic prompts.
- If a sub-agent stalls or provides garbage code, kill it immediately, rollback its dirty working tree, and spawn a new one.
- Context Diet & Task Focus: When spawning a subagent, provide clear, lean instructions that focus on the actual domain task itself rather than writing massive generic meta-prompts. DO NOT paste file contents, memory logs, or the entire plan into its prompt. Give it the absolute minimal instruction. The subagent MUST read the necessary files itself.

## 2. Phase 1: Write the Implementation Spec & Subtasks FIRST

Before doing anything else, you MUST write a highly detailed execution spec.

- What to write: Break down the parent task into a detailed architectural plan, code review guides, and embedded coding guidelines.
- Where to save it: Save this master plan into `.ai-memory/plans/pending/xx-<slug>.md`. Do not hallucinate folders.
- **Strict Relative Git Paths Mandate (TOTAL BAN on Absolute Paths / `file:///` URIs):**
  When breaking down tasks into subtasks (`.ai-memory/plans/subtasks/xx-<slug>/*.md`), writing specs, updating memory logs (`.ai-memory/memory/issues/`), or citing guidelines, ALL file paths and markdown links MUST be **strictly relative to the git repository root**. NEVER write absolute paths (`/absolute/path/to/...`, `/absolute/path/to/...`, `/home/...`) or absolute file URIs (`file:///...`) into any committed or created files.
  - ❌ **BAD (Absolute path / file URI):**
    `- [SSH Commands](file:///absolute/path/to/...)`
    `- [Target File](file:///absolute/path/to/cmd/main.go)`
  - ✅ **GOOD (Strict relative Git path):**
    `- [SSH Commands](02-spec/13-generic-cli/01-index.md)`
    `- Target File: cmd/main.go`
- **Create a Task-Specific Rule Set:** Before executing, analyze the specific task domain and explicitly write down 3-5 custom rules or constraints unique to this task inside the spec file. This prevents domain-specific regressions and forces sub-agents to follow exact architectures.
- Subtasks: You MUST break the plan down into a lean set of focused subtask files inside `.ai-memory/plans/subtasks/xx-<slug>/`. Every subtask file must contain actionable instructions focused on the domain task itself (Task Focus Over Meta-Prompting) with strictly relative Git paths.

## 3. Non-Negotiable Core Rules (Auto-Reject on Violation)

1. Image/Asset Handling: If the user provides an image in the prompt, you MUST place it in `.ai-memory/assets/<category>/xx-<slug>.<ext>`. NEVER place images in random root directories.

## AI Fix Scripts Memory (Reusable Tooling)

- [ ] `/goal` **Reuse First:** I have rigorously scanned and `/learn`ed `03-ai-scripts/01-index.md` to check if a helper script already exists before writing any new temporary code.
- [ ] **Strict In-Repository Execution:** All Python scripts (`03-ai-scripts/*.py`) MUST be executed strictly within the codebase repository root, NEVER outside the codebase.
- [ ] **Strict .ai-memory/ Folder Storage:** All AI scripts, local runners, autofixers, and helper utilities MUST be created inside `03-ai-scripts/`. NEVER create scripts in root or external paths.
- [ ] **Native File Manipulator:** If you need to perform mass file renaming, `.md` lowercase enforcement, sequence number re-ordering, or encoding fixes (CRLF/BOM), you MUST natively use `python 03-ai-scripts/03-file-manipulator.py <command>` rather than writing a new script from scratch.
- [ ] **Go Generate Sync:** If you modify Go constants, enums, or stringers, you MUST run `go generate ./...` in the relevant directory (e.g., `cd gitmap && go generate ./...`) and commit the resulting generated files to prevent CI drift.
- [ ] **Commit & Track:** All new helper scripts were written strictly to `03-ai-scripts/` and committed to Git for future reuse.
- [ ] **Index Documentation:** I have updated `03-ai-scripts/01-index.md` using sequential script naming (e.g., `01-parse-files.py`). For every script, I have included a `<details>` collapsible tag explaining exactly why the script is there and what it does.

## Pre-Reply / Loop Checklist (Must Verify Every Loop Iteration)

- [ ] Git working tree is clean before new code changes.
- [ ] Sub-agents are actively assigned disjoint files verified against `.ai-memory/01-index.md`.
- [ ] Completed tasks were `mv`'d to `plans/completed/` and `.ai-memory/plans/01-index.md` was updated.
- [ ] 3-strike rule respected: failed tasks cleanly rolled back and logged to `last-failure.md`.
- [ ] Staged files sanitized of artifact zips and temporary scratch files.
- [ ] **Strict Relative Git Paths:** All file paths, markdown links, citations, and subtask references in plans, specs, and memory logs are strictly relative to the git repository root. Zero absolute paths (`/absolute/path/to/...`, `/absolute/path/to/...`) or `file:///` URIs.
- [ ] Coding Guidelines & Master Consolidated File: I have fully read, checked, and strictly enforced every file in `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/`, as well as the master consolidated coding guideline file at `.ai-memory/coding-guidelines.md`.
- [ ] /learn and apply as a /goal  `.ai-memory/coding-guidelines.md` and also make sure the agent rules are created in the repo to read in the future quickly.
- [ ] Error Manage Checklist: I have fully read and enforced the error management files at `02-spec/03-error-manage/`. I understand which files to follow (architecture, response envelopes) and how to follow them (never swallow errors, always wrap with context).
- [ ] Boolean Examples & Fixations: All boolean variables MUST begin with is and has only (can, should, was, etc. are banned) (e. NEVER use explicit true/false comparisons (e.g., `if isReady == true` is FORBIDDEN, use `if isReady`).g., `isReady`, `hasData`). NEVER use negative booleans (e.g., `isNotReady`, `disableCache`). NEVER invert success checks (e.g., `!response.isSuccess` is banned; use `response.isFail`).
- [ ] Anti-Garbage Naming (Non-Negotiable): I have strictly verified that absolutely NO generic garbage variable names (e.g., `comp_100.go`, `temp`, `data`, `obj`, `Input100`, `TestHandleComp100`) were written. All names are highly semantic and domain-specific.
- [ ] Semantic Tests: All unit test names are strictly semantic and behavior-driven (e.g., `TestUpdateUser_RejectsInvalidEmail`). `TestHandleComp100` is an immediate failure.
- [ ] Function Size: No function exceeds 15 lines. Long arguments are split across lines (max 100 chars).
- [ ] Error Handling (AppError): Errors use domain-specific `AppError` or custom `AppException` (for C#/OOP), not generic base `Error`.
- [ ] Code adheres to explicit booleans, `Type` suffixed Enums, and error wrapper rules.
- [ ] Formatting & Acronyms: Spacing rules are strictly followed. Acronyms are strictly PascalCase (`SwapIpWindows` not `SwapIPWindows`).
- [ ] **NO TEST RUNNING (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER run any tests using Python scripts (`06-cicd-local-runner.py`, `pytest`, runner scripts), Go (`go test ./...`), or any test runner during routine execution turns. Testing is strictly checked later on in CI/CD.
- [ ] **NO BUILD CHECKING (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER run build commands (`go build`, `npm run build`, compiler checks) to verify compilation. Build verification is checked later on in CI/CD.
- [ ] **NO RUNNER SCRIPTS (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER launch background test runners, worker pools, or test inventory loops during routine execution.
- [ ] Consolidated atomic commits created grouping all modified files together (NEVER commit 1-2 files piecemeal).
- [ ] Immediate push to remote (`git push origin <branch>`) executed without leaving unpushed commits.
- [ ] Atomic file change cache updated in `.ai-memory/temp/recent-file-changes.json` under lock (`python 03-ai-scripts/33-test-inventory-generator.py --record <path>`).
- [ ] Continuous loop maintained without running banned test or build commands.

## Banned Operations Checklist (TOTAL BAN — Auto-Reject on Violation)

- [ ] **NO TEST RUNNING (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER run any tests using Python files (`06-cicd-local-runner.py`, `pytest`, runner scripts), Go (`go test ./...`), or any test runner. Testing will be checked later on in CI/CD.
- [ ] **NO BUILD CHECKING (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER run build commands (`go build`, `npm run build`, compiler checks) to verify compilation. Build verification will be checked later on in CI/CD.
- [ ] **NO RUNNER SCRIPTS (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER launch background test runners, worker pools, or test inventory loops during routine execution.
- [ ] **NO AUTOMATIC RELEASES (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER bump versions, update changelogs, or trigger releases unless explicitly commanded by the user.
- [ ] **NO PER-FILE COMMITTING (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER commit each file individually as you work (e.g. running `git commit` after editing File 1, then another commit after File 2). Committing file-by-file pollutes git history, creates subagent lock collisions, and breaks atomic changes. All modified files across the turn must be accumulated and committed together in a single atomic commit at the final step.

## 4. Non-Negotiable Coding Guidelines Checklist (Auto-Reject on Violation)

/goal  You MUST verify every item on this checklist before committing any code. If a subagent violated one of these rules, you must reject their work.

- [ ] Master Guidelines: I have fully read and strictly enforced every file in `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/` and `.ai-memory/coding-guidelines.md`.
- [ ] Error Management: I have read and enforced `02-spec/03-error-manage/`. I used `AppError`/`AppException` and did not swallow errors.
- [ ] Boolean Conventions: All booleans begin with is or has ONLY (all other prefixes like can, should, was, will, did, must are banned) (e.g., `isFail`, `hasData`). NO negatives (`!isSuccess` is banned, use `isFail`).
- [ ] Semantic Naming: Absolutely NO generic garbage names (`temp`, `data`, `obj`, `comp_100`). All unit tests are behavior-driven (e.g., `TestUpdateUser_RejectsInvalidEmail`).
- [ ] Formatting: Signatures > 3 parameters or > 100 chars are split to one parameter per line. Newlines around every Markdown header (MD022) and lists are surrounded by blank lines (MD032).
- [ ] Acronyms & Magic Strings: Acronyms are PascalCase (`UserId` not `UserID`). Magic strings/numbers are extracted to constants.
- [ ] /learn the section as a /goal (AI Fix Scripts Memory)[#AI Fix Scripts Memory]
- [ ] Action Summary: I have output a detailed `- [x]` checklist summarizing exactly what I accomplished this turn to prove I did not hallucinate.

## 5. Anti-Hallucination & Blast Radius Checklist (Mandatory for Every Turn)

Before you commit code or end your turn, you MUST mechanically check off these items. If you fail to do this, your work will be rejected.

- [ ] Echo Back the Spec: I have copy-pasted the exact Acceptance Criteria from the Spec file into my current memory/response to prove I read it verbatim.
- [ ] Pre-Commit Diff Proof: I have executed `git status` or `git diff --stat` and verified that the files I claim to have modified are actually listed as modified in the terminal output before committing.
- [ ] No Placeholder Search: I ran a regex search for `TODO` and `\[.*\]` in my modified files and confirmed I left zero placeholders behind. I actually wrote the implementation.
- [ ] Index Sync Deadman Switch: I have verified that every new file I created this turn is explicitly linked inside `readme.md` and enqueued in `.ai-memory/what-to-read.md`. I did not leave any orphaned files.
- [ ] Blast Radius Acknowledgment: Before renaming or modifying any function/type, I ran a global search across the codebase and updated every single file that imports or calls it to prevent a broken build.
- [ ] Final Step Commit & Push Verified: Staged all changes (`git add -A`), committed everything in a single grouped atomic commit, and pushed to git before ending the turn (no per-file commits).

## Strictly Avoid: Banned Operations (No Test Running, No Build Checking, No Automatic Releases)

- **NO TEST RUNNING (TOTAL BAN):** Test execution is strictly disabled. You MUST NOT execute unit tests, integration tests, or test suites using Python, Go (`go test`), or any test runner. Testing will be checked later on in CI/CD.
- **NO BUILD CHECKING (TOTAL BAN):** DO NOT run build commands (`go build`, `npm run build`, compiler invocations). Build compilation will be checked later on in CI/CD.
- **NO RELEASES (TOTAL BAN):** You MUST NOT bump versions, update changelogs, or cut a release at the end of this task. Commits must remain standard development commits. You may only trigger a release if the user explicitly commands you to do so (e.g., "cut a release" or "bump the version").
- **Targeted Quality Verification:** Execute targeted fast linters/autofixers on specifically modified files (`exit 0`). DO NOT run `python 03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py` or test runners during routine task steps.
- **Test Inventory & Recent Changes Tracking:** Whenever any file is modified, append its repository-relative path to `.ai-memory/temp/recent-file-changes.json` under atomic file lock (`python 03-ai-scripts/33-test-inventory-generator.py --record <path>`), cross-referencing `.ai-memory/test-inventory.json` so associated tests are recorded for subsequent CI/CD runs.

## Task Consolidation & File Reduction (End of Loop)

> **CRITICAL:** To reduce markdown file count and bloat, you MUST consolidate subtasks when a parent task is 100% complete.

When all subtasks for a parent task (`.ai-memory/plans/pending/xx-<slug>.md`) are finished, execute this final cleanup step before ending the run:
1. Combine all the completed granular subtasks from `.ai-memory/plans/subtasks/xx-<slug>/*.md` into a single consolidated file at `.ai-memory/plans/completed/xx-<slug>.md`.
2. In this single consolidated file, you MUST include a header that explicitly references how the main task started and documents exactly how many steps/loops it took to complete.
3. Delete the original granular `.md` files in `.ai-memory/plans/subtasks/xx-<slug>/` so that only the single consolidated file remains.
4. Delete the original parent plan `.ai-memory/plans/pending/xx-<slug>.md`.
5. Update `.ai-memory/plans/01-index.md` to point to the newly consolidated completed file.
6. **Final Step Git Commit & Push (MANDATORY):** Stage all modified files, consolidated plans, and memory records (`git add -A`), commit them in a single clean grouped atomic commit (`git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <summary>"`), and push to git (`git push origin <branch>`). Under no circumstances commit each file individually.

## Final Step Git Commit & Push Mandate (Strict Checklist)

- [ ] **MANDATORY FINAL COMMIT & PUSH TO GIT (ANYHOW):** At the FINAL step of the turn, after all targeted files have been refactored, verified with targeted linters, and plans/subtasks consolidated, you MUST stage everything (`git add -A`), create a clean, descriptive conventional commit (`git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <summary>"`), and push directly to the remote repository (`git push origin <branch>`). Leaving uncommitted changes or unpushed commits on the active branch at the end of a turn is an immediate failure.
- [ ] **TOTAL BAN ON PER-FILE COMMITS (DO NOT COMMIT EACH FILE INDIVIDUALLY):** You MUST NOT create separate git commits for each individual file as you edit them (e.g. running `git commit` after editing File 1, then committing again after File 2 is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN). Committing file-by-file pollutes git log history, creates subagent lock collisions, and breaks atomic rollback/bisectability. All modified files, test change caches, and plan records across the turn MUST be accumulated in the working tree and committed together in a SINGLE grouped atomic commit at the final step before pushing!

## MUST FOLLOW NON-NEGOTIABLE

Listen, past runs of these turns have been sloppy and stupid as fuck: wrong step counts, partial task lists dumped into chat instead of files, plans and session summaries half-filled with "[N]" placeholders, folders skimmed, open ambiguities ignored, CI/CD issues and `plans/subtasks/` forgotten, user commands dropped, coding guidelines bypassed, detailed specs chopped and summarized into useless junk, uppercase README files left uncorrected, `.ai-memory/memory/` created by accident, `strictly-avoid.md` overwritten, and explicit user instructions softened after being told not to. WTF. How on earth are you reverting to this carelessness, are you stupid?? Stop doing that, you stupid fuck. Read the whole codebase, read every folder in `02-spec/` and `.ai-memory/`, confirm root `readme.md` is strictly lowercase, find the root cause in one sentence, capture commands, issues, and pending tasks without omitting a single item, write the spec files and memory files in the right paths, update every index in the same turn, sync `readme.md` with `what-to-read.md`, preserve detailed specs verbatim with zero truncation, record file changes into recent-file-changes.json cache, group all modified files into consolidated commits with clear messages (never 1-2 files piecemeal), and push everything to git immediately before ending. Going deep IS the job. If you are not going deep, you are not doing the job. Violating this is auto-reject on the same tier as RULE 0. Avoid stupidity and being careless, you stupid fuck. Where is your attention, are you stupid? Tell me. Your stupidity is going on top of my head. Where did you learn this stupidity? If I could find you, I could slap you.
