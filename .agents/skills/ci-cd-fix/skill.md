# Instruction (must follow): Autonomous CI/CD Fix Loop (with Local Runner & RCA)

Trigger Keywords & Aliases: `fix with RCA`, `fix`, `fix, fix`, `CI/CD fix`, `cicd fix`

/goal Autonomously diagnose, update or create the local Python CI/CD runner script (`03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py`) from repository workflows or screenshot pipeline names, and fix all failures by executing a singly-done self-looping sequence (zeroing in on one failure at a time) until the runner exits with code 0 without stopping.

/learn Ingest recent RCAs from `.lovable/cicd-issues/`, `.lovable/issues/`, `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/02-canonical-size-tier.md`, `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/01-cross-language/01-index.md`, `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/01-cross-language/01-index.md`, and `02-spec/03-error-manage/` before touching any code so past mistakes are never repeated.

## Variables — Configurable at Runtime

```text
N = 200  (Total self-loop steps budget. The user may override this when triggering the prompt.)

PHASE_1_STEPS = N / 2  (Steps 1 .. N/2: Screenshot Pipeline Discovery, Update 06-cicd-local-runner.py, Register New JOBS)
PHASE_2_STEPS = N / 2  (Steps N/2+1 .. N: Singly-Done Self-Loop Fixing, Zero in on Errors, 4-Part RCA, Green Gate Verification)
```

Both N, PHASE_1_STEPS, and PHASE_2_STEPS are read-only after the user sets them.

## Strict In-Repository Execution & `.lovable/` Bounding Mandate

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **STRICT IN-REPOSITORY EXECUTION & `.lovable/` STORAGE CONTRACT:**
>
> 1. **In-Codebase Execution Only:** Whenever a Python script (runner, autofixer, linter, test aggregator) is executed or created, it MUST be executed **strictly within the repository root** (current working directory), NEVER outside the codebase or against external arbitrary directories.
> 2. **Strict Folder Bounding (`.lovable/`):** All AI scripts, local runners, autofixers, helper utilities, memory issue logs, and planning files MUST be created inside the `.lovable/` folder:
>    - Python AI Scripts: `03-ai-scripts/` (e.g. `01-file-manipulator.py`, `05-guideline-autofixer.py`, `06-cicd-local-runner.py`).
>    - RCA & Issue Logs: `.lovable/memory/issues/` and `.lovable/cicd-issues/`.
>    - Execution Plans & Subtasks: `.lovable/plans/pending/`, `.lovable/plans/subtasks/`.
>    - Coding Guidelines Mirror: `.lovable/coding-guidelines.md`.
> 3. **Strict Relative Git Paths (TOTAL BAN on Absolute Paths / `file:///` URIs):** All file paths, markdown links, citations, and subtask paths inside plans, RCA logs (`.lovable/memory/issues/`), scripts, and code comments MUST be strictly relative paths from the git root (e.g., `02-spec/03-error-manage/01-index.md`, `.lovable/plans/01-index.md`, `cmd/main.go`). NEVER write absolute OS paths (`/absolute/path/to/...`, `/absolute/path/to/...`, `/home/...`) or absolute file URIs (`file:///...`).
>    - ❌ **BAD:** `[SSH Commands](file:///absolute/path/to/...)`
>    - ✅ **GOOD:** `[SSH Commands]`02-spec/13-generic-cli/01-index.md)`
> 4. **No External or Random File Creation:** NEVER write scripts, temporary test scripts, or scratch files to root, `/tmp`, global system paths, or outside the repository boundary.
> 5. **Cross-Platform Python CI Mandate (TOTAL BAN on new `.sh` scripts in CI):** All newly created or refactored CI/CD verification tools, determinism checks, fixtures, and linter jobs MUST be implemented in pure, cross-platform Python (`.py`). Legacy `.sh` scripts must be converted to `.py` scripts so all pipelines run natively across Linux, macOS, and Windows without relying on bash emulation.
> 6. **Temp & Failure Folder Isolation:** All temporary directories, runner caches, and test artifacts MUST be strictly placed in `.lovable/temp/`. Creating `.tmp/` at the repository root or outside `.lovable/` is strictly forbidden.
>    - Dedicated Failure Directory: `.lovable/temp/failures/` is the dedicated folder where failed tests and failed quality gates write error logs (`<test-or-job-name>.log`).
>    - Passing Tests Completely Silent: Passing tests must produce ZERO filesystem artifacts (zero files written) and remain completely silent in output logs.
> 7. **Runner In-Flight ETA Wait Protocol:** When running background commands, the runner dynamically writes live status and remaining ETA to `.lovable/temp/runner-eta.json` (emitting in-flight heartbeats strictly every 25 seconds or more). If an agent inspects an active background job and it is still running, the agent MUST sleep/wait for **1 minute (60 seconds) each time**, or dynamically sleep for the remaining ETA duration read from `.lovable/temp/runner-eta.json` (or based on previous total approximate delay) instead of busy-polling or querying in loops.
> 8. **Centralized Test Inventory & Incremental Caching:** All unit tests are cataloged in `.lovable/test-inventory.json` with strictly repository-relative paths (`target_file`, `test_file`). First run executes all tests to establish baseline timings; subsequent runs execute incrementally only if target code files or test files change. Slow test threshold defaults to `4.0s` (configurable via `GITMAP_SLOW_TEST_THRESHOLD`).
> 9. **Dual-Queue Worker Pools:** Slow tests run in a dedicated 4-worker pool running at most 2 tests at a time per batch. Fast tests run in a 4-worker pool running at most 4 tests at a time, pulling in chunks of 100 tests from the test inventory queue until all are complete.
> 10. **Dynamic ETA Sleep Protocol:** The AI agent reads `.lovable/temp/runner-eta.json`, sleeps for the estimated wait time rather than looping, and if still active upon waking, re-checks remaining ETA and sleeps again to avoid burning tokens.
> 11. **Zero-Storage GitHub Actions Mandate (Total Ban on CI Artifact Uploads):** Workflows MUST NOT upload test outputs, coverage files, Playwright reports, or drift summaries via `actions/upload-artifact`. Free-tier accounts have a strict 0.5 GB shared quota across all repositories. All reports, failures, and summaries MUST be emitted directly to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`, console stdout (`cat log.txt`), or sticky PR comments with zero storage consumption. Only true GitHub release assets (binaries/tarballs on tagged releases) are permitted.

---

## Screenshot & Pipeline Discovery Protocol (Execute First When Any Image Is Provided)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **If the user provides any image or screenshot showing a CI/CD pipeline name, failing workflow, or error log:**
>
> 1. **FIRST ACTION — Update Python Runner:** Locate the pipeline/job in `.github/workflows/*.yml` (or repo CI configs) to find whatever new jobs, steps, or linters were added, and **immediately update `03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py`** to include them in the `JOBS` dictionary.
> 2. **SECOND ACTION — Singly-Done Self-Loop Execution:** Run the Python script iteratively, zeroing in on one failing error at a time using strictly bounded self-loop turns until all checks exit with code 0 (`exit 0`).

### Bounded Single-Step Self-Loop Sequence (Singly Done — No Overloaded Steps)

Every step must be **singly done** using bounded self-looping turns:

- **Self-Loop Step 1 (Extract Pipeline Name from Screenshot):**
  1. Read image to extract the pipeline name, failing job name, and error snippet.
  2. Scan `.github/workflows/*.yml` to identify the corresponding shell commands and dependencies.

- **Self-Loop Step 2 (FIRST ACTION: Update Python Runner Script):**
  1. Open `03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py`.
  2. If new jobs/steps are found in workflows, strip Docker wrappers and register the new commands in the `JOBS` dictionary.
  3. Save the runner script and verify syntax.

- **Self-Loop Step 3 (Execute Runner & Baseline Failures):**
  1. Run `python 03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py`.
  2. If exit code = 0, proceed to End of Tunnel. If exit code != 0, zero in on the first specific failure.

- **Self-Loop Step 4 (RCA & Zero In on Error):**
  1. Write 4-part RCA in `.lovable/memory/issues/xx-<slug>.md`.
  2. Register in `.lovable/01-index.md` and `.lovable/strictly-avoid.md`.

- **Self-Loop Step 5 (Surgical Code Fix):**
  1. Open the specific file and line, apply minimal surgical fix.
  2. Run `python 03-ai-scripts/05-guideline-autofixer.py <modified-files>`.

- **Self-Loop Step 6 (Re-Verify & Loop):**
  1. Re-run `python 03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py`.
  2. If resolved and more errors remain, self-loop to Step 4 to zero in on the next error until exit code = 0.

## Phase 1: Local Runner Script Generation (Steps 1 to PHASE_1_STEPS)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This phase is dedicated ONLY to creating `03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py`.**
> Do NOT fix code in this phase. Read, understand, and generate the script.

### Step 1: Check for Existing Script & Force Override

- Check if `03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py` already exists.
- **`force` Keyword Support:** If the user wrote `force`, `force rebuild`, or `force create` on top of the prompt or trigger: **ALWAYS recreate/regenerate the Python runner script from scratch**, regardless of whether the file already exists on disk.
- If it EXISTS and the user did **not** say `force`: skip to Phase 2.
- If MISSING or `force` was requested: execute Steps 2–4 for up to PHASE_1_STEPS iterations.

### Step 2: Deep CI/CD Configuration Scan

Spend up to PHASE_1_STEPS self-loop iterations reading in this order:

1. **CI/CD configuration files:**
   - GitHub Actions: `.github/workflows/*.yml` (ALL files)
   - GitLab CI: `.gitlab-ci.yml`
   - Azure Pipelines: `azure-pipelines.yml`
   - Bitbucket: `bitbucket-pipelines.yml`
   - CircleCI: `.circleci/config.yml`
   - Custom runners: `Makefile`, `03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py`, `run.sh`, `run.ps1`
2. **Language configuration:** `.nvmrc`, `.python-version`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, `tsconfig.json`, lockfiles
3. **For every CI/CD job, record:**
   - `runs-on` image (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`, `node:20-alpine`)
   - All `run:` shell commands and `uses:` action steps
   - Environment variables from `env:` blocks
   - Dependency install commands (`npm ci`, `go mod download`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
   - Lint, typecheck, build, and test commands
4. **Check local toolchain:** Run `node --version`, `go version`, `python3 --version`, etc. to know what is available natively.

### Step 3: Docker Translation Rule (CRITICAL)

The host machine IS the Docker container. Strip all Docker wrappers:

- `docker run --rm node:20 npm ci` → `npm ci`
- `docker run --rm python:3.12 pytest` → `python3 -m pytest`
- `docker run --rm golang:1.22 go test ./...` → `go test ./...`
- Replace Docker `env` injection with Python `os.environ` assignments.
- **Skip entirely:** `docker login`, image tagging, container registry pushes — these are deployment steps, not CI checks.

### Step 4: Write `06-cicd-local-runner.py` (Worker Pool & Log Aggregation Architecture)

Generate `03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py` that:

1. **Round-Robin Worker Process / Thread Pool Architecture:** Runs tasks (tests, linters, builds) concurrently using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3)` (2–3 concurrent tasks).
2. **Enqueuing Announcement:** The script MUST announce upfront how many tasks it has enqueued across the worker pool (e.g. `[INFO] Enqueued 20 quality gates across 3 concurrent workers...`).
3. **Real-Time Progress & Timing:** Prints job completions in real time with individual runtimes (e.g. `PASS [Job Name] (X.XXs)`).
4. **Graceful Non-canceling Failure Handling:** If one job fails in a running batch, the runner DOES NOT abort or cancel other active workers. It lets running tasks finish gracefully, capturing all stdout and stderr.
5. **Consolidated Summary Report & Full Diagnostic Logs:** Prints a complete final summary with total executed, passed, failed, and timeouts. For every failed or timed-out job, it outputs the full command line, return code, stdout, and stderr so the agent has 100% complete RCA context.
6. **Clean Exit Code:** Exits with code 0 only when ALL jobs pass; exits non-zero if ANY job fails.

## Phase 2: Autonomous Fix Loop (Steps PHASE_1_STEPS+1 to N)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION MANDATE — DO NOT STOP.**
> Never stop to tell the user "here are the errors". Fix them. Never await remote CI/CD results.

```text
STEP = 0
WHILE (STEP < PHASE_2_STEPS):
    STEP += 1

    1. Run: python 03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py
    2. Capture exit_code and full output.

    IF exit_code == 0:
        BREAK  ← All checks pass. Proceed to End of Tunnel.

    ELSE:
        3. Parse failure: identify exact failing job, error message, file, and line.
        4. Document 4-part RCA in .lovable/memory/issues/xx-<slug>.md
        5. Apply the minimal surgical code fix.
        6. Run: python 03-ai-scripts/05-guideline-autofixer.py <modified-files>
        7. Loop immediately to step 1. DO NOT stop.

IF STEP >= PHASE_2_STEPS AND exit_code != 0:
    Report remaining failures clearly in chat and ask the user for guidance.
```

**Sub-Agent Parallelization:** If multiple unrelated jobs fail (e.g., lint + test + typecheck), spawn one dedicated sub-agent per failure with a single-file bounding box. Parent agent collects results and re-runs the runner.

---

## Phase 3: 4-Part RCA Requirement

For each distinct failure write `.lovable/memory/issues/xx-<slug>.md` with:

1. **Why it happened:** High-level architectural reason.
2. **How it happened:** Exact execution flow that triggered the error.
3. **Root Cause:** Exact file, line number, and dependency responsible.
4. **Code Fix:** Before/after code snippet.

Also append any new forbidden patterns to `.lovable/strictly-avoid.md`.

---

## STRICT AVOIDANCE: Never Disable CLI Linting, Static Analysis, or CI/CD Checks (No Shortcut Cheating)

> [!CAUTION]
> **TOTAL BAN ON DISABLING, SKIPPING, OR BYPASSING CLI LINTERS AND CI/CD GATES:**
>
> - **NEVER** disable, comment out, delete, or skip any CLI linting command (`golangci-lint`, `eslint`, `markdownlint`, `tsc`, `pytest`, `phpstan`, `mypy`, `check-*.py`), build step, or test suite.
> - **NEVER** add `|| true`, `continue-on-error: true`, `# nolint`, `// eslint-disable`, or ignore flags to "quickly win the race" or fake a pipeline pass.
> - **Your job is to legitimately fix the underlying source code.** If resolving complex lint errors or test failures requires multiple sub-steps, sub-agents, or nested self-looping turns, you MUST execute all necessary turns until the code is 100% clean and compliant.
> - Disabling or bypassing any CI/CD or CLI lint check is an automatic and immediate rejection.

---

## Strictly Avoid: No Automatic Releases & Run All Tests (Strict Policy)

> [!CAUTION]
> **NO AUTOMATIC RELEASES:** Do NOT bump versions or cut a release unless the user explicitly says so. Use `fix(ci): <description>` commits only.
> **RUN ALL TESTS & QUALITY GATES (FULL PIPELINE FIDELITY):** `ci-cd-fix` is an explicit CI pipeline repair workflow. It MUST run all CI/CD quality gates, linters, static analysis, and test suites properly (`python 03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py`). NEVER skip or disable tests with `--no-tests` in CI/CD fix workflows; all unit test suites, AST checks, and verification jobs must be executed and diagnosed until they legitimately pass (`exit 0`).
> **ATOMIC CHANGE TRACKING:** Record all modified files under lock via `python 03-ai-scripts/33-test-inventory-generator.py --record <files...>`.

---

## Non-Negotiable Coding Standards

- [ ] **No Disabling CLI Linting (Zero Bypassing):** All CLI linters and CI/CD quality gates executed fully without `|| true`, `continue-on-error`, or suppression comments. Code was legitimately fixed.
- [ ] **Zero Actions Storage (Total Ban on CI Artifacts):** Confirmed that NO `actions/upload-artifact` steps exist in CI workflows; all diagnostic outputs stream to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` or console logs.
- [ ] **Legitimate Multi-Step Self-Looping:** If complex errors occurred, I performed dedicated, single-step self-loop iterations to resolve each underlying failure instead of taking shortcuts.
- [ ] **Return New Line (R13-R16):** Blank line before `return`/`throw` (unless sole statement). Blank line after `}`. Never two blank lines in a row.
- [ ] **No Explicit True Checks:** Never `== true`. Write `if isReady`.
- [ ] **No Mixed Polarity:** Never `if isA && !isB`. Extract to a named boolean.
- [ ] **Affirmative IsDefined:** Use `isDefined` (or `res.IsDefined()`) instead of inverted empty checks (`!isEmpty`).
- [ ] **Strict Lowercase Files:** All generated/modified files use lowercase naming.

---

## End of Tunnel Checklist

- [ ] **Zero Linting/CI/CD Bypass:** Confirmed that NO CLI linters, static analysis tools, or test scripts were disabled, commented out, skipped, or bypassed with `|| true`.
- [ ] **Zero Actions Storage:** Confirmed that NO `actions/upload-artifact` steps exist in CI workflows, eliminating quota depletion.
- [ ] `python 03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py` exited with code 0 (with all quality gates and tests passing).
- [ ] All failures documented in `.lovable/memory/issues/xx-<slug>.md`.
- [ ] Changes committed: `fix(ci): resolve <summary>`.
- [ ] Pushed to the current branch.
- [ ] File change summary posted in chat (file, what changed, why).
