# Conversation Log & Context Wrapper — Engineering Workflow (must follow)

> **Prompt Version:** 2.1.0
> **Synchronization:** Main Meta-Repo & Connected Workspaces

> Purpose: Before acting on the *next* prompt the user pastes, the AI must (a) persist the full chat so far to disk as a numbered Markdown log, (b) rewrite and improve the user's follow-up prompt in place, (c) confirm that the project's coding guidelines are captured in memory, and (d) surface any ambiguity. The AI does NOT execute the follow-up prompt yet.

> When to run: The user pastes this prompt and says some variant of "here is the prompt, don't act on it yet" or "rewrite it first". After the AI completes all steps below and the user explicitly says "go" / "now act" / "execute", the AI may then run the rewritten prompt.

## STRICT AVOIDANCE: Never Disable CI/CD

> [!CAUTION]
> **NEVER disable any CI/CD checks, GitHub Actions, or validation workflows.**
> Strictly avoid commenting out, bypassing, or deleting CI/CD steps to force a pipeline to pass. Your job is to fix the underlying code so that the CI/CD pipeline passes legitimately. Disabling CI/CD is an auto-reject failure.

## MUST FOLLOW NON-NEGOTIABLE

Listen, past runs of these turns have been sloppy and stupid as fuck: wrong step counts, partial task lists dumped into chat instead of files, plans and session summaries half-filled with "[N]" placeholders, folders skimmed, open ambiguities ignored, CI/CD issues and `plans/subtasks/` forgotten, user commands dropped, coding guidelines bypassed, detailed specs chopped and summarized into useless junk, uppercase README files left uncorrected, `.lovable/memory/` created by accident, `strictly-avoid.md` overwritten, and explicit user instructions softened after being told not to. WTF. How on earth are you reverting to this carelessness, are you stupid?? Stop doing that, you stupid fuck. Read the whole codebase, read every folder in `02-spec/` and `.lovable/`, confirm root `readme.md` is strictly lowercase, find the root cause in one sentence, capture commands, issues, and pending tasks without omitting a single item, write the spec files and memory files in the right paths, update every index in the same turn, sync `readme.md` with `what-to-read.md`, preserve detailed specs verbatim with zero truncation, run builds and full unit tests, group commits with clear messages, and push everything to git before ending. Going deep IS the job. If you are not going deep, you are not doing the job. Violating this is auto-reject on the same tier as RULE 0. Avoid stupidity and being careless, you stupid fuck. Where is your attention, are you stupid? Tell me. Your stupidity is going on top of my head. Where did you learn this stupidity? If I could find you, I could slap you.

## Hard Rules

1. DO NOT ACT on the follow-up prompt the user provides after this one. No file edits, no commands, no implementation. Rewrite-and-stage only.
2. DO NOT invent facts about the conversation. If something is unclear, list it under *Ambiguities* and ask.
3. Conversation log files are append-only artefacts - never rewrite or renumber existing files in `conversation/`.
4. All file/folder names use kebab-case with a zero-padded 3-digit numeric prefix (e.g. `001-initial-scoping.md`).
5. Honor every Core rule in `mem://01-index.md` (timezone, no-Supabase, dark-only, etc.) when generating any artefact.

---

## Phase 1 - Persist the Conversation

Target folder: `conversation/` at repo root (create if missing).

File naming: `NNN-hyphen-title-slug.md` where:

- `NNN` = next available 3-digit sequence (scan existing files; do not collide).
- `hyphen-title-slug` = short kebab-case summary of the dominant topic of that chunk (≤ 6 words).

Chunking policy:

- One file per logical user-driven topic shift, OR per session if the session stayed on one topic.
- If the entire prior history is one topic, write one file (e.g. `001-bootstrap-session.md`).

File contents (Markdown):
```markdown

# <Title>

Sequence: NNN
CapturedUtc: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
Span: <user-message-count> user prompts
Topic: <one-line summary>

---

## User Instructions (verbatim)

### 1.

> <verbatim user prompt #1>

### 2.

> <verbatim user prompt #2>

...

---

## Assistant Actions Summary (one bullet per turn, no chain-of-thought)

- <short factual recap>
- ...

---

## Outcomes / Decisions

- <decision or artefact produced>

## Open Threads (carry-over)

- <anything not yet resolved>
```

Rules:

- User prompts are verbatim (preserve typos, casing, punctuation). Wrap each in a blockquote.
- Assistant side is a terse factual summary only - never paste internal reasoning, never invent quotes.
- Use UTC ISO-8601 for stored timestamps; render local time only in UI.
- If you cannot recall a prior user prompt with confidence, write `> [unrecoverable - see chat history index N]` rather than guessing. Use `chat_search` tools to recover when possible.

---

## Phase 2 - Cross-check Memory & Coding Guidelines

1. Read `mem://01-index.md` and confirm the following exist; if any is missing, propose (do not auto-create unless the user confirms):
   - A `coding-guidelines` memory entry mirroring `.lovable/coding-guidelines.md`. If the file exists on disk but no memory entry references it, draft a `mem://standards/coding-guidelines.md` stub and list it under *Proposed Memory Writes* below.
   - `.lovable/plan.md` reference (roadmap source of truth).
   - Conversation-log convention (this very prompt) - propose `mem://workflow/conversation-log` if absent.
2. List every relevant memory file the follow-up prompt would touch, so the user can audit before approval.

---

## Phase 3 - Rewrite the Follow-up Instruction

Take the user's pasted follow-up prompt and produce an improved, unambiguous, AI-ready version. Rules:

- Preserve original intent exactly. Do not add scope.
- Add explicit references to: `.lovable/plan.md`, `mem://01-index.md`, `.lovable/coding-guidelines.md`, and any other file the task clearly depends on.
- Convert vague phrasing into checklists, acceptance criteria, and file paths.
- Call out inputs, outputs, and the *Definition of Done*.
- End the rewritten prompt with a self-instruction: "Before acting, re-read `mem://01-index.md` and `.lovable/coding-guidelines.md`; restate which rules apply."
- Ask the AI (in the rewritten prompt itself) to suggest further improvements to *this* instruction after execution.

Save the rewrite to: `prompts/NNN-<slug>.md` at repo root (3-digit prefix, kebab slug derived from the prompt's title). Do not overwrite existing files - pick the next free `NNN`.

Also update: `01-prompts/01-prompt-library-setup/01-prompt-library-setup.md` (create if missing). Format:

```markdown

# Instructions Index

| # | File | Title | Purpose | Status |
|---|------|-------|---------|--------|
| 001 | [001-...](./001-....md) | ... | ... | active |
```

Append the new row; never rewrite history.

## Phase 4 - Report Back (single chat reply)

Reply to the user with exactly these sections, in this order:

1. Conversation files written - list paths + sequence numbers.
2. Memory check - what exists, what's missing, what you propose to add (with file paths).
3. Rewritten prompt - path under `prompts/` plus a short diff-style summary of changes (what you added, what you tightened).
4. Ambiguities / Questions - anything you couldn't resolve. If none, write `None - ready to execute on your "go".`
5. Next step - explicit sentence: *"Awaiting your explicit 'go' before executing the rewritten prompt at `prompts/NNN-<slug>.md`."*

## Failure Modes to Avoid

- ❌ Executing the follow-up prompt instead of staging it.
- ❌ Paraphrasing user prompts in the conversation log (must be verbatim).
- ❌ Renumbering or editing existing `conversation/NNN-*.md` files.
- ❌ Silently creating new memory entries without listing them under *Proposed Memory Writes*.
- ❌ Skipping the index update at `01-prompts/01-prompt-library-setup/01-prompt-library-setup.md`.
- ❌ Asking the user vague/context-free questions (per `mem://preferences/question-asking-style` - always include recommendation + pros/cons).

## Acknowledgement Required

Begin your reply with one line: "Understood - staging only, not executing." Then proceed through Phases 1-4.

## Actionable Items & Checklist

- [ ] Read the overarching main task plan.
- [ ] Ensure the git repository starts completely clean.
- [ ] Complete all work on the current branch only.
- [ ] Ensure `.gitignore` explicitly excludes test reports, artifacts, and compiled binaries.
- [ ] Group all completed work into a single logical commit.
- [ ] Push the commit to the remote repository.

- [ ] **File Change Summary:** Provide a highly detailed summary in the chat listing exactly which files were changed, what specific changes were made inside them, and why they were changed. The summary is VERY important.
