# Parent Task N-Step Continuous Loop & Multi-Agent Orchestration — Workflow (must follow)

> **Prompt Version:** 2.2.0
> **Synchronization:** Main Meta-Repo & Connected Workspaces

/goal Autonomously orchestrate and execute the parent task by decomposing it into subtasks and running a continuous N-step self-loop until completion without a single failure.

```text
N = 150
```

N = total self-loop steps budget that the agents will perform.

### Master Task Checklist (Atomic Numbered Steps)

1. [ ] /goal Phase 1 (Step 0 - Verbatim Prompt Recording & Task Extraction): Immediately capture the user's prompt verbatim into `.ai-memory/plans/pending/xx-<slug>.md` under `## User Request (Verbatim)`, extract actionable bullet-point tasks under `## Extracted Actionable Task List`, and output this confirmed task list directly in chat to confirm understanding.
2. [ ] /goal Phase 1 (Planning & Spec Generation, Steps 1..N/2): Spawn exactly 2 planning subagents (max 2 threads each) to scan the codebase and draft `.ai-memory/plans/pending/xx-<slug>.md`.
3. [ ] /goal Phase 1 (Subtask Decomposition): Decompose the plan into a lean set of actionable subtasks. Do not over-prompt or generate excessive markdown files. Keep subtasks focused purely on execution and the domain task itself in `.ai-memory/plans/subtasks/xx-<slug>/*.md`.
4. [ ] /goal Phase 1 (Strict Folder Bounding): Restrict all planning logs, active locks, and status reports strictly within `.ai-memory/` (`.ai-memory/plans/`, `.ai-memory/01-index.md`).
5. [ ] /goal Phase 1 (Zero-Stop Transition): Immediately upon completing Phase 1, self-loop and transition directly into Phase 2 execution mode without pausing or stopping.
6. [ ] /goal Phase 2 (Execution & Code Refactoring, Steps N/2+1..N): Spawn exactly 2 execution subagents (max 2 threads each) to execute subtasks on disjoint files in parallel.
7. [ ] /goal Phase 2 (Failure Memory & Error Recovery): If a subagent fails, record the failure log in `.ai-memory/plan.md` and `.ai-memory/memory/issues/`; subsequent agents MUST read the failure log first to remediate root causes.
8. [ ] /goal Phase 2 (Change Recording & Quality Linting): Record all modified files into `.ai-memory/temp/recent-file-changes.json` under lock (`python 03-ai-scripts/33-test-inventory-generator.py --record <files...>`) and run targeted file-level linters/autofixers on specifically modified files (`exit 0`). DO NOT run `06-cicd-local-runner.py`, unit tests, or build checks (deferred to CI/CD).
9. [ ] /learn Ingest `.ai-memory/memory/01-index.md` for project memory index and past learnings.
10. [ ] /learn Ingest `.ai-memory/strictly-avoid.md` for banned anti-patterns and strict constraints.
11. [ ] /learn Ingest `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/` for domain-specific architectural specifications.
12. [ ] /learn Ingest `02-spec/03-error-manage/` for error handling architectures and AppError.
13. [ ] /learn Ingest `.ai-memory/coding-guidelines.md` for master consolidated coding guidelines.
14. [ ] /goal Create or update agent rules in the repository if missing from agent memory.

```text
PHASE_1_STEPS = N / 2   (Steps 1 .. N/2: 2-Agent Planning & Subtask Generation in .ai-memory/plans/)
PHASE_2_STEPS = N / 2   (Steps N/2+1 .. N: 2-Agent Parallel Execution, Self-Looping, CI Quality Gates)
```

N, PHASE_1_STEPS, and PHASE_2_STEPS are read-only after initialization. Never modify them mid-execution.

## Phase 0: Antigravity Skill Bootstrap (Memory Optimization)

Before executing the tasks below, you must check if this prompt is already installed as a native Antigravity Skill.

1. If `.agents/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md` does not exist in the workspace, you MUST create it now.
2. Extract the core instructions of this prompt and save it into that `SKILL.md` using the standard YAML frontmatter (with `name` and `description`).
3. Once installed, you can rely on progressive disclosure for future runs. Do not keep the entire prompt in your active memory if you don't need it.

---

## 1. 2-Agent Concurrency & Ruthless Orchestration

/goal You are the master orchestrator. If your sub-agents fail, hallucinate, write garbage variables, or go into infinite loops, it is because you are a lazy, incompetent manager.

- **Strict 2-Agent Limit (Max 2 Threads Each):** When dispatching work in Phase 1 (planning) or Phase 2 (execution), you MUST spawn **at most 2 sub-agents concurrently**, with **no more than 2 threads per agent**.
- **Strict Folder Bounding (`.ai-memory/`):** Subagents are strictly restricted to writing planning files, subtasks, status reports, and logs inside `.ai-memory/` (`.ai-memory/plans/`, `.ai-memory/01-index.md`, `.ai-memory/memory/issues/`).
- **Context Diet:** When spawning a subagent, DO NOT paste file contents, memory logs, or the entire plan into its prompt. Give it the absolute minimal instruction (e.g., "Read subtask file `.ai-memory/plans/subtasks/xx-slug/01-<subtask-title>.md` and execute it"). The subagent MUST read the necessary files itself.
- **Fail Fast & Kill Stalls:** If a sub-agent stalls or provides garbage code, kill it immediately, rollback its dirty working tree, and spawn a new one.

---

## 2. Phase 1: Planning Mode & Subtask Generation FIRST (Steps 1 .. N/2)

Before writing any source code changes, you MUST execute Phase 1:

1. **Verbatim Prompt Capture & Task Extraction (First Action):** Directly write the user's prompt verbatim into the planning spec at `.ai-memory/plans/pending/xx-<slug>.md` under a dedicated `## User Request (Verbatim)` section. Extract the specific task list from this prompt as actionable bullet points / checklist items under `## Extracted Actionable Task List`. The AI MUST output this extracted checklist directly in chat confirming: *"Confirmed Task Deliverables: 1. [task 1], 2. [task 2]..."* before taking further actions.
2. **Scan & Discover:** Spawn 2 planning subagents to deeply scan the codebase for target changes or violations.
3. **Master Spec Generation:** Save the master architectural plan into `.ai-memory/plans/pending/xx-<slug>.md`.
4. **Task-Specific Rule Set:** Write down 3–5 custom rules or constraints unique to this task inside the spec file.
5. **Lean Subtask Decomposition:** Break down the plan into a few highly focused subtask files in `.ai-memory/plans/subtasks/xx-<slug>/01-<subtask-title>.md`, `02-<subtask-title>.md`, etc. **Task Focus Over Meta-Prompting:** Your goal is to write code and solve the problem, not just generate more AI prompts. Subagent instructions should clearly define the domain task itself.
6. **Strict Relative Git Paths:** All markdown links and file paths in subtasks MUST be strictly relative to the repository root (e.g. `.ai-memory/spec/...`, `src/...`). Zero absolute paths (`/absolute/path/to/...`, `/absolute/path/to/...`) or `file:///` URIs.
7. **MANDATORY AUTO-LOOP (DO NOT STOP):** As soon as Phase 1 planning completes, the master orchestrator **MUST NOT STOP or ask the user for permission**. It MUST immediately self-loop and transition directly into Phase 2 execution mode.

---

## 3. Phase 2: Execution Mode & Parallel Refactoring (Steps N/2+1 .. N)

1. **Parallel Dispatch:** Spawn 2 execution subagents (max 2 threads each) assigned to disjoint subtasks from `.ai-memory/plans/subtasks/xx-<slug>/`.
2. **File Locking:** Verify subagents operate on distinct files using `.ai-memory/01-index.md`.
3. **Execution & Coding Guidelines:** Subagents refactor code following all coding guidelines (<= 8–15 line functions, single return types, universal `*AppError` wrapping, Unix LF line endings).
4. **Failure Memory & Feedback Loop:** If a subagent fails:
   - Rollback dirty changes and write the failure error log to `.ai-memory/plan.md` and `.ai-memory/memory/issues/xx-failure.md`.
   - The next subagent spawned MUST read the previous failure log first, record it as a pending memory task, and implement the necessary fix.
5. **Progress & Completion:** Move completed subtasks to `.ai-memory/plans/completed/` and update `.ai-memory/plans/01-index.md`.
6. **Atomic Change Tracking:** Append all modified files to `.ai-memory/temp/recent-file-changes.json` under lock (`python 03-ai-scripts/33-test-inventory-generator.py --record <files...>`), mapping to associated tests in `.ai-memory/test-inventory.json` for subsequent CI/CD verification.
7. **TOTAL BAN on Test Running:** DO NOT run any tests using Python scripts (`06-cicd-local-runner.py`, `pytest`), Go (`go test`), or any test runner during routine execution turns. All test execution is strictly deferred to CI/CD pipelines and dedicated fix workflows.
8. **TOTAL BAN on Build Checking:** DO NOT run build verification commands (`go build`, `npm run build`, compiler invocations). Build compilation is checked later on in CI/CD.
9. **Targeted Quality Linting Only:** Run only targeted, fast file-level linters/autofixers on specifically modified files (`exit 0`). DO NOT run `06-cicd-local-runner.py` or full test suites.

### Remote CI/CD Pipeline Monitoring & Dynamic Waiting Protocol (GitMap Pipeline-AI)

When monitoring or checking remote CI/CD pipelines (e.g., following git push or during pipeline audits):

1. **Mandatory GitMap Pipeline-AI Authority:** Agents MUST use GitMap CLI to retrieve remote CI/CD status:
   ```bash
   gitmap pipeline-ai status --json
   # or alias:
   gitmap pl-ai status --json
   ```
   Parse structured output fields: `is_running`, `status`, `etaSeconds`, and `nextAiCommand`.
2. **Anti-Credit-Waste Waiting Mandate (TOTAL BAN on Rapid Polling):**
   - NEVER loop rapidly or busy-poll (`gh run view` in tight loops). Rapid polling burns user credits, exhausts LLM tokens, and wastes rate limits.
   - When a pipeline is in progress (`is_running: true`), agents MUST wait/sleep based on the estimated completion duration (`etaSeconds` or `-t <sec>`):
     ```bash
     gitmap pipeline-ai status -t <etaSeconds>
     ```
   - Proportional ETA sleep guidelines:
     - `etaSeconds > 120`: wait 20s–30s before querying again.
     - `60 < etaSeconds <= 120`: wait 10s–20s before querying again.
     - `etaSeconds <= 60`: wait 5s–10s before querying again.
3. **Targeted Failure Diagnostics:** Use GitMap's automated error extraction to isolate actionable failure lines (`##[error]`, `FAIL:`, compile errors) without fetching noisy passing step logs.

---

## 4. AI Fix Scripts Memory (Reusable Tooling)

- [ ] `/goal` **Reuse First:** Scanned and learned `03-ai-scripts/01-index.md` before writing temporary code.
- [ ] **Strict In-Repository Execution:** All Python scripts executed strictly within the codebase repository root.
- [ ] **Strict .ai-memory/ Folder Storage:** All helper scripts, local runners, and linters stored in `03-ai-scripts/`.
- [ ] **Native File Manipulator:** Use `python 03-ai-scripts/03-file-manipulator.py <command>` for mass file operations.
- [ ] **Go Generate Sync:** If Go constants or enums are modified, run `go generate ./...` in the relevant package and commit generated files.

---

## 5. Banned Operations Checklist (TOTAL BAN — Auto-Reject on Violation)

- [ ] **NO TEST RUNNING (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER run any tests using Python scripts (`06-cicd-local-runner.py`, `pytest`, runner scripts), Go (`go test ./...`), or any test runner during routine execution turns. Testing is strictly checked later on in CI/CD.
- [ ] **NO BUILD CHECKING (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER run build commands (`go build`, `npm run build`, compiler checks) to verify compilation. Build verification is checked later on in CI/CD.
- [ ] **NO RUNNER SCRIPTS (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER launch background test runners, worker pools, or test inventory loops during routine execution.
- [ ] **NO AUTOMATIC RELEASES (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER bump versions, update changelogs, or trigger releases unless explicitly commanded by the user.
- [ ] **NO PER-FILE COMMITTING (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER commit each file individually as you work (e.g. running `git commit` after editing File 1, then another commit after File 2). Committing file-by-file pollutes git history, creates subagent lock collisions, and breaks atomic changes. All modified files across the turn must be accumulated and committed together in a single atomic commit at the final step.
- [ ] **NO RAPID CI/CD POLLING (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER query or loop rapidly (`gh run view` in tight loops) when inspecting remote CI/CD pipelines. Agents MUST query pipeline state using GitMap Pipeline-AI (`gitmap pipeline-ai status --json` or `gitmap pl-ai status -t <sec>`) and strictly wait/sleep based on `etaSeconds` to eliminate credit waste.

---

## 6. Non-Negotiable Coding Guidelines Checklist (Auto-Reject on Violation)

/goal You MUST verify every item on this checklist before committing any code. If a subagent violated one of these rules, you must reject their work.

- [ ] Master Guidelines: Fully enforced every file in `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/` and `.ai-memory/coding-guidelines.md`.
- [ ] Error Management: Enforced `02-spec/03-error-manage/` using domain-specific `AppError`, never generic error.
- [ ] Boolean Conventions: All booleans begin with is or has ONLY (all other prefixes like can, should, was, will, did, must are banned). NO negatives (`!isSuccess` is banned; use `isFail`).
- [ ] Semantic Naming: Zero generic garbage names (`temp`, `data`, `obj`). Behavior-driven unit test names.
- [ ] Multi-Line Arguments (Rule 9a/9b): Signatures and call sites with >2 arguments formatted one argument per line with trailing commas.
- [ ] Line Endings & Encoding: Strictly Unix LF (`\n`) and UTF-8 without BOM.
- [ ] Function Sizing: Functions <= 8 lines preferred (hard cap 15 lines).
- [ ] Strict Relative Git Paths: Zero absolute paths (`/absolute/path/to/...`, `/absolute/path/to/...`) or `file:///` URIs.

---

## 7. Anti-Hallucination & Blast Radius Checklist

- [ ] Echo Back the Spec: Verified Acceptance Criteria from the Spec file verbatim.
- [ ] Pre-Commit Diff Proof: Verified `git status` shows actual modified files before committing.
- [ ] No Placeholder Search: Confirmed zero `TODO` or `\[.*\]` placeholders remain in modified files.
- [ ] Index Sync Deadman Switch: Every new file is explicitly linked in `readme.md` and enqueued in `.ai-memory/what-to-read.md`.
- [ ] Blast Radius Acknowledgment: Global search across codebase performed to update all callers of modified symbols.
- [ ] Continuous Loop Maintained: Continuous self-loop executed until 100% complete without running banned test/build commands (all testing and build verification deferred to CI/CD).
- [ ] Final Step Commit & Push Verified: Staged all changes (`git add -A`), committed everything in a single grouped atomic commit, and pushed to git before ending the turn (no per-file commits).

## Continuous 2-Phase Self-Loop & 2-Agent Concurrency Architecture

To guarantee full execution without stopping after planning mode, the master orchestrator MUST enforce this continuous 2-phase loop:

### 1. 2-Agent Concurrency & Strict `.ai-memory/` Bounding

- **2-Agent Limit (Max 2 Threads Each):** When dispatching work, spawn **at most 2 sub-agents concurrently**, with **no more than 2 threads per agent**.
- **Strict Folder Bounding (`.ai-memory/`):** Subagents can ONLY write planning files, subtasks, status reports, and logs inside `.ai-memory/` (`.ai-memory/plans/`, `.ai-memory/01-index.md`, `.ai-memory/memory/issues/`).
- **Context Diet & Task Focus:** Provide subagents with clear, lean instructions that focus on the actual domain task itself. Do not write massive meta-prompts or generate excessive boilerplate markdown. Do not paste huge files into agent prompts.

### 2. Phase 1: Planning Mode & Subtask Generation (Steps 1 .. N/2)

- **Verbatim Prompt Recording & Task Extraction (First Action):** Write the user request verbatim into `.ai-memory/plans/pending/xx-<slug>.md` under `## User Request (Verbatim)`, extract the bulleted actionable deliverables under `## Extracted Actionable Task List`, and output the confirmed task deliverables directly in chat to verify understanding.
- Spawn 2 planning subagents to scan the codebase for target guideline violations.
- Write the master architectural specification in `.ai-memory/plans/pending/xx-audit.md` with an exhaustive Violation Ledger table.
- **Lean Subtask Decomposition:** Break down the plan into a few highly focused subtask files in `.ai-memory/plans/subtasks/xx-<parent-slug>/01-<subtask-title>.md`, `02-<subtask-title>.md`, etc. **Task Focus Over Meta-Prompting:** Your goal is to write code and solve the problem, not just generate more AI prompts. Subagent instructions should clearly define the domain task itself.
- **MANDATORY AUTO-LOOP (DO NOT STOP):** Once Phase 1 planning completes, the master orchestrator **MUST NOT STOP or ask the user for confirmation**. It MUST immediately self-loop and transition directly into Phase 2 execution mode.

### 3. Phase 2: Execution Mode & Parallel Refactoring (Steps N/2+1 .. N)

- Spawn 2 execution subagents (max 2 threads each) to execute subtasks in parallel on disjoint files.
- Subagents refactor code following all coding guidelines (<= 8–15 line functions, single return types, universal `*AppError` wrapping, Unix LF line endings).
- Move completed subtasks from `.ai-memory/plans/subtasks/` to `.ai-memory/plans/completed/` and update `.ai-memory/plans/01-index.md`.
- **Failure Memory & Feedback Loop:** If a subagent fails:
  - Rollback dirty working tree and log error details to `.ai-memory/plan.md` and `.ai-memory/memory/issues/xx-failure.md`.
  - The next subagent spawned MUST read the previous failure log first, record it as a pending memory task, and implement the necessary fix.
- Execute targeted local linters on modified files ensuring `exit 0` before concluding. DO NOT run `06-cicd-local-runner.py`, unit test suites, or build checks during routine loops.
- **TOTAL BAN on Test Running & Build Checking:** All test runs (`go test`, `pytest`, python runners) and build checks (`go build`, compiler verification) are strictly banned during routine execution. Verification will be checked later on in CI/CD.
- Record all modified files to `.ai-memory/temp/recent-file-changes.json` under lock (`python 03-ai-scripts/33-test-inventory-generator.py --record <files...>`) for subsequent CI/CD runs. When inspecting remote CI/CD pipelines, agents MUST follow GitMap (`gitmap pipeline-ai status --json` / `gitmap pl-ai status -t <sec>`) and adaptively wait based on `etaSeconds` to avoid credit waste.

### 4. Per-Task Agent Isolation & Workspace Subfolders (`.ai-memory/temp-agents/xx-<task-name>/`)

To prevent cross-task pollution and ensure seamless agent communication, every task MUST create a dedicated subfolder in `.ai-memory/temp-agents/xx-<task-name>/`:
1. **Per-Task Isolation:** On task start, the assigned subagent creates its isolated directory `.ai-memory/temp-agents/xx-<task-name>/`.
2. **State & Progress Tracking:** Create `.ai-memory/temp-agents/xx-<task-name>/state.md` documenting:
   - Task sequence and target deliverables.
   - Files assigned for modification.
   - Current subtask step and completion percentage.
3. **Inter-Agent Communication & Scratch Space:**
   - All intermediate findings, scratch outputs, and dependency handoffs between agents working on this task MUST be written inside `.ai-memory/temp-agents/xx-<task-name>/`.
4. **On Error/Crash:** Append the exact error, root cause, and `STATUS: FAILED` to `.ai-memory/temp-agents/xx-<task-name>/state.md` before exiting.
5. **On Success:** Mark `STATUS: DONE` in `.ai-memory/temp-agents/xx-<task-name>/state.md`, aggregate findings to the master plan, and clean up or archive the folder.

## Task Consolidation & File Reduction (End of Loop)

> **CRITICAL:** To reduce markdown file count and bloat, you MUST consolidate subtasks when a parent task is 100% complete.

When all subtasks for a parent task (`.ai-memory/plans/pending/xx-<slug>.md`) are finished, execute this final cleanup step before ending the run:
1. Combine all the completed granular subtasks from `.ai-memory/plans/subtasks/xx-<slug>/*.md` into a single consolidated file at `.ai-memory/plans/completed/xx-<slug>.md`.
2. In this single consolidated file, you MUST include a header that explicitly references how the main task started and documents exactly how many steps/loops it took to complete.
3. Delete the original granular `.md` files in `.ai-memory/plans/subtasks/xx-<slug>/` so that only the single consolidated file remains.
4. Delete the original parent plan `.ai-memory/plans/pending/xx-<slug>.md`.
5. Update `.ai-memory/plans/01-index.md` to point to the newly consolidated completed file.
6. **Final Step Git Commit & Push (MANDATORY):** Stage all modified files, consolidated plans, and memory records (`git add -A`), commit them in a single clean grouped atomic commit (`git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <summary>"`), and push to git (`git push origin <branch>`). Under no circumstances commit each file individually.

---

## Final Step Git Commit & Push Mandate (Strict Checklist)

- [ ] **MANDATORY FINAL COMMIT & PUSH TO GIT (ANYHOW):** At the FINAL step of the turn, after all targeted files have been refactored, verified with targeted linters, and plans/subtasks consolidated, you MUST stage everything (`git add -A`), create a clean, descriptive conventional commit (`git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <summary>"`), and push directly to the remote repository (`git push origin <branch>`). Leaving uncommitted changes or unpushed commits on the active branch at the end of a turn is an immediate failure.
- [ ] **TOTAL BAN ON PER-FILE COMMITS (DO NOT COMMIT EACH FILE INDIVIDUALLY):** You MUST NOT create separate git commits for each individual file as you edit them (e.g. running `git commit` after editing File 1, then committing again after File 2 is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN). Committing file-by-file pollutes git log history, creates subagent lock collisions, and breaks atomic rollback/bisectability. All modified files, test change caches, and plan records across the turn MUST be accumulated in the working tree and committed together in a SINGLE grouped atomic commit at the final step before pushing!
