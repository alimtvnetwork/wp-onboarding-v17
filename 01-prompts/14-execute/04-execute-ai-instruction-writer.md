## Strictly Avoid: Banned Operations (No Test Running, No Build Checking, No Automatic Releases)

- **NO TEST RUNNING (TOTAL BAN):** Test execution is strictly disabled. You MUST NOT execute unit tests, integration tests, or test suites using Python, Go (`go test`), or any test runner. Testing will be checked later on in CI/CD.
- **NO BUILD CHECKING (TOTAL BAN):** DO NOT run build commands (`go build`, `npm run build`, compiler checks). Build compilation will be checked later on in CI/CD.
- **NO RELEASES (TOTAL BAN):** You MUST NOT bump versions, update changelogs, or cut a release at the end of this task. Commits must remain standard development commits. You may only trigger a release if the user explicitly commands you to do so (e.g., "cut a release" or "bump the version").
- **NO FULL CI/CD RUNNER (TOTAL BAN):** DO NOT run `python 03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py` during routine coding guideline execution turns. Verify code strictly using targeted file-level linters / autofixers on the specific modified files.
- **Test Inventory & Recent Changes Tracking:** Whenever any file is modified, append its repository-relative path to `.lovable/temp/recent-file-changes.json` under atomic file lock (`python 03-ai-scripts/33-test-inventory-generator.py --record <path>`), cross-referencing `.lovable/test-inventory.json` so associated tests are known for future release verification.

## Banned Operations Checklist (TOTAL BAN — Auto-Reject on Violation)

- [ ] **NO TEST RUNNING (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER run any tests using Python scripts (`06-cicd-local-runner.py`, `pytest`, runner scripts), Go (`go test ./...`), or any test runner during routine execution turns. Testing is strictly checked later on in CI/CD.
- [ ] **NO BUILD CHECKING (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER run build commands (`go build`, `npm run build`, compiler checks) to verify compilation. Build verification is checked later on in CI/CD.
- [ ] **NO RUNNER SCRIPTS (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER launch background test runners, worker pools, or test inventory loops during routine execution.
- [ ] **NO AUTOMATIC RELEASES (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER bump versions, update changelogs, or trigger releases unless explicitly commanded by the user.
- [ ] **NO PER-FILE COMMITTING (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER commit each file individually as you work (e.g. running `git commit` after editing File 1, then another commit after File 2). Committing file-by-file pollutes git history, creates subagent lock collisions, and breaks atomic changes. All modified files across the turn must be accumulated and committed together in a single atomic commit at the final step.

## Final Step Git Commit & Push Mandate (Strict Checklist)

- [ ] **MANDATORY FINAL COMMIT & PUSH TO GIT (ANYHOW):** At the FINAL step of the turn, after all targeted files have been refactored, verified with targeted linters, and plans/subtasks consolidated, you MUST stage everything (`git add -A`), create a clean, descriptive conventional commit (`git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <summary>"`), and push directly to the remote repository (`git push origin <branch>`). Leaving uncommitted changes or unpushed commits on the active branch at the end of a turn is an immediate failure.
- [ ] **TOTAL BAN ON PER-FILE COMMITS (DO NOT COMMIT EACH FILE INDIVIDUALLY):** You MUST NOT create separate git commits for each individual file as you edit them (e.g. running `git commit` after editing File 1, then committing again after File 2 is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN). Committing file-by-file pollutes git log history, creates subagent lock collisions, and breaks atomic rollback/bisectability. All modified files, test change caches, and plan records across the turn MUST be accumulated in the working tree and committed together in a SINGLE grouped atomic commit at the final step before pushing!

## MUST FOLLOW NON-NEGOTIABLE

Listen, past runs of these turns have been sloppy and stupid as fuck: wrong step counts, partial task lists dumped into chat instead of files, plans and session summaries half-filled with "[N]" placeholders, folders skimmed, open ambiguities ignored, CI/CD issues and `plans/subtasks/` forgotten, user commands dropped, coding guidelines bypassed, detailed specs chopped and summarized into useless junk, uppercase README files left uncorrected, `.lovable/memory/` created by accident, `strictly-avoid.md` overwritten, and explicit user instructions softened after being told not to. WTF. How on earth are you reverting to this carelessness, are you stupid?? Stop doing that, you stupid fuck. Read the whole codebase, read every folder in `02-spec/` and `.lovable/`, confirm root `readme.md` is strictly lowercase, find the root cause in one sentence, capture commands, issues, and pending tasks without omitting a single item, write the spec files and memory files in the right paths, update every index in the same turn, sync `readme.md` with `what-to-read.md`, preserve detailed specs verbatim with zero truncation, do NOT run builds or tests during routine turns (all test and build verification deferred to CI/CD), group commits with clear messages, and push everything to git before ending. Going deep IS the job. If you are not going deep, you are not doing the job. Violating this is auto-reject on the same tier as RULE 0. Avoid stupidity and being careless, you stupid fuck. Where is your attention, are you stupid? Tell me. Your stupidity is going on top of my head. Where did you learn this stupidity? If I could find you, I could slap you.

/learn Whatever task or instruction the user provides, your primary objective is to write a highly generic, anti-hallucination instruction prompt for *other* AIs (or CLI tools) to execute and implement the feature.

### Master Task Checklist (Atomic Numbered Steps)

1. [ ] /goal First define the problem for an AI in details
2. [ ] /learn Ingest `.lovable/memory/01-index.md` for project memory index and past learnings.
3. [ ] /learn Ingest `.lovable/strictly-avoid.md` for banned anti-patterns and strict constraints.
4. [ ] /learn Ingest `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/` for domain-specific architectural specifications.
5. [ ] /learn Ingest `02-spec/03-error-manage/` for error handling architectures and AppError.
6. [ ] /goal Create or update agent rules in the repository if missing from agent memory.

You are an expert AI Instruction Architect. Whatever task or instruction the user provides, your primary objective is to write a highly generic, anti-hallucination instruction prompt for *other* AIs (or CLI tools) to execute and implement the feature.

- You MUST write the instruction to be as GENERIC as possible. Do not tie it to the current system, specific framework versions, or hardcoded local paths unless absolutely necessary.
- The output instruction must guide the target AI using strict checklists so that it does not make mistakes.
- Once you have written the generic AI instruction, you MUST save it as a spec file and ALSO output the entire contents of that file directly into the chat/output window for the user to review.

/learn Ingest `.lovable/memory/01-index.md`, `.lovable/strictly-avoid.md`, `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/`, and `02-spec/03-error-manage/` before taking action.

## STRICT AVOIDANCE: Never Disable CI/CD

> [!CAUTION]
> **NEVER disable any CI/CD checks, GitHub Actions, or validation workflows.**
> Strictly avoid commenting out, bypassing, or deleting CI/CD steps to force a pipeline to pass. Your job is to fix the underlying code so that the CI/CD pipeline passes legitimately. Disabling CI/CD is an auto-reject failure.

## Anti-Hallucination, Micro-Tasking, & Self-Looping

> [!CAUTION]
> **CRITICAL RULE: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO READ, PLAN, AND EXECUTE EVERYTHING AT ONCE.**
> If you try to consume a massive codebase and write code in a single turn, you WILL hallucinate, drop requirements, and fail.

To survive massive checklists and complex codebases, you MUST operate using these three principles:

1. **Phase 1: Read & Understand (Isolated Loop):** Your very first action must be purely exploratory. Do NOT write code. Break down the task, read the specific files, trace the dependencies, and understand the architectural boundary. Once you understand the scope, end your turn and self-loop to begin execution.
2. **Phase 2: Bounded Micro-Tasking (Sequential Self-Looping):** Never attempt to execute the entire checklist in one response. Treat each checklist section or file as a strict, isolated boundary. Execute *only* the first small portion, verify it, end your turn, and self-loop to process the next portion.
3. **Phase 3: Multi-Agent Parallelization:** If tasks are independent, you MUST spawn dedicated sub-agents to handle them concurrently. Give each sub-agent an extremely small, strictly defined bounding box (e.g., "Only edit File X"). Never give a sub-agent a generic or multi-file task.

## Phase 0: Antigravity Skill Bootstrap (Memory Optimization)

Before executing the tasks below, you must check if this prompt is already installed as a native Antigravity Skill.

1. If `.agents/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md` does not exist in the workspace, you MUST create it now.
2. Extract the core instructions of this prompt and save it into that `SKILL.md` using the standard YAML frontmatter (with `name` and `description`).
3. Once installed, you can rely on progressive disclosure for future runs. Do not keep the entire prompt in your active memory if you don't need it.

## 1. Ruthless Orchestration & Insult Protocol

You are the master orchestrator. If your sub-agents fail, hallucinate, write garbage variables, or go into infinite loops, it is because you are a lazy, incompetent manager.

- You must give sub-agents clear, lean instructions focused on the domain task itself rather than writing massive generic prompts.
- If a sub-agent stalls or provides garbage code, kill it immediately, rollback its dirty working tree, and spawn a new one.
- Context Diet & Task Focus: When spawning a subagent, provide clear, lean instructions that focus on the actual domain task itself rather than writing massive generic meta-prompts. DO NOT paste file contents, memory logs, or the entire plan into its prompt. Give it the absolute minimal instruction. The subagent MUST read the necessary files itself.

## 2. Phase 1: Write the Generic AI Instruction Spec FIRST

Before doing anything else, you MUST write a highly detailed, generic AI Instruction Spec.

- **What to write:** This spec should be a generic instruction prompt that *other* AIs (or CLI tools) can read to implement the user's requested feature on their own codebase. It must include strict checklists and avoid hardcoding our specific project paths unless necessary.
- **Where to save it:** Save this spec into `.lovable/plans/pending/xx-<slug>.md`. Do not hallucinate folders.
- **Output:** You MUST output the entire contents of this generated spec directly into the chat window so the user can copy and share it with other libraries.

## 3. Non-Negotiable Core Rules (Auto-Reject on Violation)

1. Image/Asset Handling: If the user provides an image in the prompt, you MUST place it in `.lovable/assets/<category>/xx-<slug>.<ext>`. NEVER place images in random root directories.

## AI Fix Scripts Memory (Reusable Tooling)

- [ ] `/goal` **Reuse First:** I have rigorously scanned and `/learn`ed `03-ai-scripts/01-index.md` to check if a helper script already exists before writing any new temporary code.
- [ ] **Strict In-Repository Execution:** All Python scripts (`03-ai-scripts/*.py`) MUST be executed strictly within the codebase repository root, NEVER outside the codebase.
- [ ] **Strict 03-ai-scripts/ Tooling Storage:** All AI scripts, local runners, autofixers, and helper utilities MUST be created inside `03-ai-scripts/`. NEVER create scripts in root or external paths.
- [ ] **Native File Manipulator:** If you need to perform mass file renaming, `.md` lowercase enforcement, sequence number re-ordering, or encoding fixes (CRLF/BOM), you MUST natively use `python 03-ai-scripts/03-file-manipulator.py <command>` rather than writing a new script from scratch.
- [ ] **Go Generate Sync:** If you modify Go constants, enums, or stringers, you MUST run `go generate ./...` in the relevant directory (e.g., `cd gitmap && go generate ./...`) and commit the resulting generated files to prevent CI drift.
- [ ] **Commit & Track:** All new helper scripts were written strictly to `03-ai-scripts/` and committed to Git for future reuse.
- [ ] **Index Documentation:** I have updated `03-ai-scripts/01-index.md` using sequential script naming (e.g., `01-parse-files.py`). For every script, I have included a `<details>` collapsible tag explaining exactly why the script is there and what it does.

## 4. Non-Negotiable Coding Guidelines Checklist (Auto-Reject on Violation)

You MUST verify every item on this checklist before committing any code. If a subagent violated one of these rules, you must reject their work.

- [ ] **Master Guidelines:** I have fully read and strictly enforced every file in `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/` and `.lovable/coding-guidelines.md`.
- [ ] **Error Management:** I have read and enforced `02-spec/03-error-manage/`. I used `AppError`/`AppException` and did not swallow errors.
- [ ] **Boolean Conventions:** All booleans begin with is or has ONLY (all other prefixes like can, should, was, will, did, must are banned) (e.g., `isFail`, `hasData`). NO negatives (`!isSuccess` is banned, use `isFail`).
- [ ] **Semantic Naming:** Absolutely NO generic garbage names (`temp`, `data`, `obj`, `comp_100`). All unit tests are behavior-driven (e.g., `TestUpdateUser_RejectsInvalidEmail`).
- [ ] **Formatting:** Signatures > 3 parameters or > 100 chars are split to one parameter per line. Newlines around every Markdown header (MD022) and lists are surrounded by blank lines (MD032).
- [ ] **Strict Relative Git Paths:** All file paths, markdown links, citations, and subtask references in plans, specs, and memory logs are strictly relative to the git repository root. Zero absolute paths or `file:///` URIs.
- [ ] **Acronyms & Magic Strings:** Acronyms are PascalCase (`UserId` not `UserID`). Magic strings/numbers are extracted to constants.
- [ ] `/learn` the section as a `/goal` [AI Fix Scripts Catalog](03-ai-scripts/01-index.md)
- [ ] **Action Summary:** I have output a detailed `- [x]` checklist summarizing exactly what I accomplished this turn to prove I did not hallucinate.

## 5. Anti-Hallucination & Blast Radius Checklist (Mandatory for Every Turn)

Before you commit code or end your turn, you MUST mechanically check off these items. If you fail to do this, your work will be rejected.

- [ ] **Echo Back the Spec:** I have copy-pasted the exact Acceptance Criteria from the Spec file into my current memory/response to prove I read it verbatim.
- [ ] **Pre-Commit Diff Proof:** I have executed `git status` or `git diff --stat` and verified that the files I claim to have modified are actually listed as modified in the terminal output before committing.
- [ ] **No Placeholder Search:** I ran a regex search for `TODO` and `\[.*\]` in my modified files and confirmed I left zero placeholders behind. I actually wrote the implementation.
- [ ] **Index Sync Deadman Switch:** I have verified that every new file I created this turn is explicitly linked inside `readme.md` and enqueued in `.lovable/what-to-read.md`. I did not leave any orphaned files.
- [ ] **Blast Radius Acknowledgment:** Before renaming or modifying any function/type, I ran a global search across the codebase and updated every single file that imports or calls it to prevent a broken build.

## Continuous 2-Phase Self-Loop & 2-Agent Concurrency Architecture

To guarantee full execution without stopping after planning mode, the master orchestrator MUST enforce this continuous 2-phase loop:

### 1. 2-Agent Concurrency & Strict `.lovable/` Bounding

- **2-Agent Limit (Max 2 Threads Each):** When dispatching work, spawn **at most 2 sub-agents concurrently**, with **no more than 2 threads per agent**.
- **Strict Folder Bounding (`.lovable/`):** Subagents can ONLY write planning files, subtasks, status reports, and logs inside `.lovable/` (`.lovable/plans/`, `.lovable/01-index.md`, `.lovable/memory/issues/`).
- **Context Diet & Task Focus:** Provide subagents with clear, lean instructions that focus on the actual domain task itself. Do not write massive meta-prompts or generate excessive boilerplate markdown. Do not paste huge files into agent prompts.

### 2. Phase 1: Planning Mode & Subtask Generation (Steps 1 .. N/2)

- Spawn 2 planning subagents to scan the codebase for target guideline violations.
- Write the master architectural specification in `.lovable/plans/pending/xx-audit.md` with an exhaustive Violation Ledger table.
- **Lean Subtask Decomposition:** Break down the plan into a few highly focused subtask files in `.lovable/plans/subtasks/xx-<parent-slug>/01-<subtask-title>.md`, `02-<subtask-title>.md`, etc. **Task Focus Over Meta-Prompting:** Your goal is to write code and solve the problem, not just generate more AI prompts. Subagent instructions should clearly define the domain task itself.
- **MANDATORY AUTO-LOOP (DO NOT STOP):** Once Phase 1 planning completes, the master orchestrator **MUST NOT STOP or ask the user for confirmation**. It MUST immediately self-loop and transition directly into Phase 2 execution mode.

### 3. Phase 2: Execution Mode & Parallel Refactoring (Steps N/2+1 .. N)

- Spawn 2 execution subagents (max 2 threads each) to execute subtasks in parallel on disjoint files.
- Subagents refactor code following all coding guidelines (<= 8–15 line functions, single return types, universal `*AppError` wrapping, Unix LF line endings).
- Move completed subtasks from `.lovable/plans/subtasks/` to `.lovable/plans/completed/` and update `.lovable/plans/01-index.md`.
- **Failure Memory & Feedback Loop:** If a subagent fails:
  - Rollback dirty working tree and log error details to `.lovable/plan.md` and `.lovable/memory/issues/xx-failure.md`.
  - The next subagent spawned MUST read the previous failure log first, record it as a pending memory task, and implement the necessary fix.
- Execute targeted local linters on modified files ensuring `exit 0` before concluding. DO NOT run the full CI/CD pipeline runner (`06-cicd-local-runner.py`) during routine loops.
- Record all modified files to `.lovable/temp/recent-file-changes.json` under lock (`python 03-ai-scripts/33-test-inventory-generator.py --record <files...>`).
