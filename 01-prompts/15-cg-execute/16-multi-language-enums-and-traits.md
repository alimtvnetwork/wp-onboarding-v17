[/goal](slashCommand;goal) Autonomously scan, plan, refactor, and fix all Enum, Trait, and Pattern Matching architectures across Go, TypeScript, PHP, Rust, and Python codebases, enforcing string-backed enums, `HasEnumHelpers` traits, exhaustive pattern matching, `*Type` suffixes, central `enums/` folder collocation, and strict relative Git paths: FIRST showcase and list out the given task in visible chat during Turn 1, capture it verbatim, plan it in the repo, spawn autonomous subagents via `invoke_subagent` (A = 2, H = 2; solo execution without calling `invoke_subagent` is an auto-reject failure) in disjoint file boxes using GitMap high-speed commands as primary, prove every single claim with concrete evidence, enforce coding guidelines to 100%, and finish with one atomic GitMap commit that holds strictly this task's files.

[/learn](slashCommand;learn) Enforce the Top-Instruction Priority Mandate: whatever directives, custom requirements, checklists, or user instructions are provided ABOVE this prompt outrank everything below. Turn 1 MUST showcase the given task list in visible chat before any background execution. Each rule is stated once (R1 to R16) and cited by ID. Progress lives in the ledger and in `.ai-memory/plans/`, never only in chat.

[/plan](slashCommand;plan) Execute thorough step-by-step planning in the repository before execution. Ensure all deliverables, architecture boundaries, and requirements are clearly defined in the audit ledger and subtask plans before dispatching worker waves.

### 🚨 MANDATORY SUBAGENT SPAWNING GATE (A = 2, H = 2 — ZERO SOLO EXECUTION ALLOWED)

- **ACTUAL TOOL CALL REQUIRED:** You must ACTUALLY CALL the `invoke_subagent` tool via your tool-calling API. Do NOT just print the text "Dispatched Worker..." and stop. If you only print text, the agents will not spawn and the task will fail! You must execute the `invoke_subagent` JSON tool payload.
- **3-STAGE MANDATORY DISPATCH:** You must invoke `A = 2` agents (`invoke_subagent`) at EVERY stage of the workflow:
  1. **Planning Step:** Spawn 2 subagents to research the codebase and author the step-by-step execution plan.
  2. **Spec Step:** Spawn 2 subagents to write the detailed architectural spec.
  3. **Execution Step:** Spawn 2 worker subagents to execute the actual code modifications.
- **SOLO EXECUTION IS AN AUTO-REJECT FAILURE:** The lead orchestrator is **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** from executing planning, spec writing, or code changes by itself without calling the `invoke_subagent` tool. Failing to call the actual tool is a critical protocol violation.

## Phase 0: Antigravity Skill Bootstrap (Memory Optimization)

Before executing the tasks below, check if this prompt is already installed as a native Antigravity Skill.

1. If `.agents/skills/<slug>/skill.md` does not exist in the workspace, create it now.
2. Extract the core instructions of this prompt and save it into that `skill.md` using the standard YAML frontmatter (with `name` and `description`).
3. Once installed, rely on progressive disclosure for future runs. Do not keep the entire prompt in active memory if not needed.

---

## The Unified Master Pipeline (Atomic Numbered Steps)

Execute this task via a strict 3-Phase pipeline. Do not skip steps.

### Phase 1A: Verbatim Capture, Task Extraction & Chat Output Gate (Step 0)

Before executing any file searches, scans, spec writing, or code changes, you must execute Phase 1A:

1. **Top-Instruction Priority Verification:** Whatever directives, constraints, checklists, or instructions are given before this section or prompt (user preamble, header constraints, prior instructions) must be verified as highest priority and non-negotiable.
2. **Showcase Given Task First (Turn 1 Action):** In your VERY FIRST response turn upon receiving the prompt, you MUST output the confirmed task breakdown directly in visible chat. Never execute tools silently without displaying the task breakdown to the user first!
3. **Lossless Verbatim Capture:** Store incoming prompt losslessly under `## User Request (Verbatim)` in canonical spec and parent plan.
4. **Screenshots & Media:** Decode base64/screenshots immediately into `assets/screenshots/<slug>-<NN>.png`. Reference via relative markdown links (`![Screenshot](assets/screenshots/<slug>-<NN>.png)`).
5. **Discrete Deliverables Extraction:** Break down whatever user requirements were given into discrete, actionable items with ordered traceable IDs (`Task-01`, `Task-02`, ...).
6. **Mandatory Same-Turn Tool Chaining (TOTAL BAN ON TURNING OFF):** Emit the breakdown in chat with clean vertical formatting, and in the **EXACT SAME TURN**, invoke your first tool call (e.g. `write_to_file` to initialize ledger/spec, or run preflight). NEVER emit text alone (which ends the turn prematurely), and never ask "Should I proceed?".

```markdown
### 📋 Confirmed Task Breakdown & Requirement Ingestion

1. **Task-01: [Descriptive Task Title]**
   - **State:** `[IN PROGRESS — EXECUTING IMMEDIATELY]`
   - **Understood:** `[YES]` — [1-2 concise sentences proving understanding of intent, scope, and verified constraints]
   - **Actionable Scope:** [Precise technical deliverable and implementation scope]
   - **Target Files / Area:** `[relative/path/or/module]`

2. **Task-02: [Descriptive Task Title]**
   - **State:** `[QUEUED — EXECUTING NOW WITHOUT USER PROMPT]`
   - **Understood:** `[YES]` — [1-2 concise sentences proving understanding of intent, scope, and verified constraints]
   - **Actionable Scope:** [Precise technical deliverable and implementation scope]
   - **Target Files / Area:** `[relative/path/or/module]`

Proceeding directly to Preflight & Phase 1B Spec Generation (Active Tool Call Running Below).
```

---

## 1. Precedence Hierarchy & Scope (Highest First)

1. **User Instructions & Preamble:** Directives and parameters ABOVE this prompt outrank everything below.
2. **Platform Limits:** Native tools, Artifact Review Policy, permission prompts, hooks. Never claim to override them.
3. **Repo Rules:** `agents.md`, `.ai-memory/strictly-avoid.md`, and `coding-guidelines.md`.
4. **This Prompt.**

If sources conflict, follow stricter one and record under `Conflicts:` in ledger.

### Scope Control Rules
- **Turn 1 Task Showcase:** In your very first response turn, you MUST showcase and list out the given task in visible chat. Running tools silently without presenting the task breakdown is strictly banned.
- **Read budget:** Read only requested paths, search hits, and Step 0 context.
- **History read-only:** Never edit past events, changelogs, completed plans, release notes, or `06-old-prompts/` and `19-old-execute-prompts/`.
- **Out-of-scope:** Log under `Follow-ups:` in plan; never fix in this run.
- **Minimal diff:** Change only lines required; never reflow unaffected lines.
- **Indexes:** Update `01-prompts/readme.md` and `.ai-memory/prompts.md` only when adding/modifying prompts. Update `.ai-memory/plans/readme.md` and `02-spec/21-app/readme.md` every run. Register recent completed tasks before push.
- **Mandatory Multi-Agent Partitioning:** Even for tasks touching few files, work MUST be partitioned across A workers (e.g. Worker 01 implements changes, Worker 02 implements verification/linters/companion tests). Solo execution is strictly banned.
- **Finish early:** When all Task-IDs are `DONE`, proceed directly to consolidation.
- **Zero releases:** Never bump versions or edit changelogs unless requested (R10).

---

## 2. Core Operational Rules (Cite by ID)

- **R1 Zero Builds or Test Suites (TOTAL BAN).** NEVER run `go build`, `npm run build`, `vite build`, `go test ./...`, `pytest`, `npm test`, or `03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py`. CI verifies builds and suites. Routine turns must never waste time on heavy compilation/tests. Only explicit user command lifts this.
- **R2 Targeted Checks Only.** Run only fast, file-scoped checks on specifically modified files (see Section 10). A check scanning 0 files is a **FAIL**.
- **R3 Evidence or It Did Not Happen.** Every `DONE`, `PASS`, or "verified" claim MUST cite a concrete file path, git diffstat, or command exit code (`exit 0`). Vague assurances are auto-rejected.
- **R4 Never Invent Commands, Flags, or Paths.** Verify commands with a harmless call (`gitmap lf readme.md`), not `--help`. Use documented fallbacks and log in ledger.
- **R5 Mandatory Subagents (`invoke_subagent`).** Spawning subagents via `invoke_subagent` (`A = 2`, `H = 2`) is an **ABSOLUTE MUST** (`research` for discovery in Phase 1, `self` for edits in Phase 2). The lead agent is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from executing all reads or edits solo. Solo execution without calling `invoke_subagent` is an auto-reject failure on the same tier as Rule 0.
- **R6 One Owner Per File (Disjoint Bounding Boxes).** Within every worker wave, each file has exactly one owner. Shared indexes (`.ai-memory/plans/readme.md`, `.ai-memory/prompts.md`, `.ai-memory/what-to-read.md`, `02-spec/21-app/readme.md`, directory `readme.md`) belong exclusively to lead.
- **R7 Git Safety & Isolation.** Subagents never run git commands or alter git state. Nobody runs `git reset --hard`, `git checkout --`, `git clean`, `git stash`, or force pushes.
- **R8/R9 Atomic Commit & Push via GitMap.** The run ends with one GitMap call: `gitmap cpf "<summary>"` (features) or `gitmap cpb "<summary>"` (fixes). GitMap stages, commits, and pushes. Never commit file-by-file. Before GitMap, all push gates must pass (targeted checks, secrets gate, and `.gitignore` hygiene; untrack any ignored files: `git rm --cached`). Push rejected: `git pull --rebase`, re-run command. Miss after push: allow one follow-up `gitmap cpb "<summary>"`, logged as `FOLLOW_UP_PUSH: <sha>`. Never amend pushed commits. Workers never run git commands or GitMap commit tools; only lead does.
- **R10 Zero Unauthorized Releases.** Never bump versions, edit `version.json`, update changelogs, or trigger release scripts unless user explicitly requested release.
- **R11 Strict Relative Git Paths & Lowercase Hygiene.** Strict ban on absolute paths (`C:\...`, `/home/...`) and `file:///` URIs. Paths relative from git root. New filenames and specs strictly lowercase.
- **R12 No Polling / Immediate Turn Yielding.** Print progress line (`Dispatched Worker 01 .. Worker <A> (wave k / WAVES); waiting for their results.`) and **STOP CALLING TOOLS**. Never poll in loop. Check `manage_subagents` once if wave runs long.
- **R13 Two-Strike Retry Cap & Anti-Looping.** Tool failing twice: worker replies `STATUS: BLOCKED` with exact error and stops. Lead takes over and logs `LEAD_FALLBACK: <reason>`. Subtask failing two remediation rounds is marked `FAILED` with RCA (Section 12).
- **R14 100% Ambiguity & Decision Boundaries.** Non-blocking: choose conservative option, log in ledger `Assumptions:`, proceed. Blocking: `ask_question` once, log in `.ai-memory/ambiguous-questions/01-new-ambiguity/`, continue unblocked tasks.
- **R15 Zero Generated Artifacts Committed.** Never commit build caches, logs, temp scripts, or newly generated code (Hard Rule 1) unless repository already tracked them.
- **R16 Zero Secrets in Standard Repos.** Never write credentials, tokens, passwords, or `.env` contents into tracked files, commits, ledger, plans, specs, or prompts (`agents.md` section 9).
  - *Secrets Gate (lead, before GitMap call):*
    1. Check changed/new files via `git status --porcelain`.
    2. Run `python linter-scripts/check-forbidden-strings.py`.
    3. Search files via `gitmap aum search -r "(BEGIN [A-Z ]*PRIVATE KEY|AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}|gh[pousr]_[A-Za-z0-9]{36}|sk-[A-Za-z0-9]{20,}|xox[baprs]-[A-Za-z0-9-]{10,})"` for private keys, AWS, GitHub, OpenAI, Slack tokens, or secret/token assignments (NEVER run `git grep` or `Select-String`), AWS (`AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}`), GitHub (`gh[pousr]_[A-Za-z0-9]{36}`), OpenAI (`sk-[A-Za-z0-9]{20,}`), Slack (`xox[baprs]-[A-Za-z0-9-]{10,}`), or secret/token assignments.
    4. On hit: if `repo-secrets` exists in default work directory, store via `gitmap rs text "<value>" --slug <slug>` (or `gitmap rs file <path>`) and replace with env var/placeholder; if not, remove value and `ask_question` once. Log `SECRET_OFFLOADED: <file>:<line>` without value.
    5. Never print secrets in chat/logs; refer to file:line only. Workers finding a secret report `BLOCKED: secret at <file>:<line>`. Never put repository URLs or absolute paths into secrets instructions (`agents.md` section 9).

---

## 3. GitMap High-Speed Command Primacy (Run Everything Faster)

GitMap is your **PRIMARY** acceleration engine. NEVER use generic PowerShell search cmdlets (`Select-String`, `Get-ChildItem`), `git grep`, `grep`, or `findstr`. Execute all searches and operations through GitMap:

| Operation | Primary GitMap Command | High-Speed Alias | Purpose & Advantage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Live Streaming Search** | `gitmap aum search "<pattern>" [dir] [-e <.ext>] [-r] [-i]` | `gitmap aum grep "<pat>"` | Multi-core streaming live file search (replaces `Select-String`, `git grep`) |
| **Indexed Symbol Search** | `gitmap search "<query>" [--limit <n>]` | `gitmap search` | Instant SQLite cached keyword/symbol search across indexed repos |
| **Wildcard File Search** | `gitmap find "<pattern>" [-ext <ext>]` | `gitmap f "<pat>"` | Index-accelerated multi-core glob filename finder |
| **Directory Inventory** | `gitmap list-files [pattern] [-ext <ext>]` | `gitmap lf [pat]` | Instant indexed repository inventory |
| **Substring File Search** | `gitmap find-files-any "<substring>"` | `gitmap ffa "<str>"` | High-speed partial filename matcher |
| **Stream File** | `gitmap cat <filepath>` | `gitmap cat` | Zero-disk memory streaming to stdout |
| **PowerShell Runner** | `gitmap pwsh "<command>"` | `gitmap ps "<cmd>"` | High-speed PowerShell execution with `-NoProfile` |
| **Bash Runner** | `gitmap bash "<command>"` | `gitmap sh "<cmd>"` | Standard cross-platform Bash command execution |
| **Offload Secrets** | `gitmap rs file <filepath>` / `folder` / `text` | `gitmap rs` | Auto-commits into `repo-secrets` in work directory |
| **Offload Scripts** | `gitmap rc file <file.ps1>` / `text` | `gitmap rc` | Auto-commits reusable scripts into `repo-cache` |
| **Atomic Commits** | `gitmap cpf "<summary>"` (Feature) / `cpb` (Bug) | `gitmap cpf` | Stages, commits with prefix, and pushes atomically |
| **Pipeline Waiting** | `gitmap pipeline-ai status --json` | `gitmap pl-ai` | Non-polling dynamic ETA CI/CD monitor |

### 🔍 Code & Symbol Search Protocol (TOTAL BAN ON `Select-String` & `git grep`)
- **Live Disk Search (Default for discovery, symbol tracking & blast radius):**
  - Search string/symbol: `gitmap aum search "<symbol>" [dir] [-e <.ext>]` (e.g. `gitmap aum search "RunFleetPASCommand" cli -e .go`)
  - Search regex: `gitmap aum search -r "<regex>" [dir] [-e <.ext>]` (e.g. `gitmap aum search -r "("pas"|"pa")" cli/cmd -e .go`)
  - Case-insensitive: `gitmap aum search -i "<query>" [dir]`
- **TOTAL BAN:** NEVER run PowerShell `Select-String`, `Get-ChildItem -Recurse`, `git grep`, `grep`, or `findstr`. Running generic shell searches wastes execution steps, slows turns, and violates GitMap primacy.

---

## 5. Step 0: Preflight, Platform Handshake & Ledger Creation (Phase 1 Budget)

1. **Platform Handshake:** Confirm tools (`invoke_subagent`, `send_message`, `manage_subagents`, `ask_question`, `write_to_file`, `replace_file_content`, `run_command`). If `task_boundary` exists: set `PLANNING` (Phase 1), `EXECUTION` (Phase 2), `VERIFICATION` (Phase 3).
2. **Commands & Directory:** Confirm `gitmap --version` and `python --version` exit 0. Verify GitMap with harmless call (`gitmap lf readme.md`), not `--help`. `run_command` uses `Cwd` in workspace root, paths relative. Never cd to other drives or tool folders.
3. **Working Tree Cleanliness:** Run `git status --porcelain`. Record modified files in ledger; never touch them. Confirm root `readme.md` is lowercase. Read `.ai-memory/what-to-read.md`, `strictly-avoid.md`, `coding-guidelines.md`.
4. **Resume Procedure (Check Before Creating):**
   - Match `.ai-memory/temp-agents/*/ledger.md` on `Request slug:` and `Request first line:`. No match: start fresh.
   - Status `COMPLETE`: verify commit in `git log`, report "Already complete: <sha>", stop.
   - Status `ACTIVE`: log `RESUMED_FROM: step x, phase p, wave k`; if `Pushed: yes`, proceed to final report; if workers in flight, re-dispatch; if subtask has diff, verify and mark `DONE` or re-dispatch; subtasks marked `DONE` are never redone. Continue from `Next action:`. Never run `git reset`, `git stash`, `git clean`, or `git checkout --`.
5. **Ledger Creation:** If not resuming, create `.ai-memory/temp-agents/NN-<slug>/ledger.md`:

```markdown
# Ledger: NN-<slug>
Request slug: <slug>
Request first line: <verbatim first line>
Status: ACTIVE
Phase: 1    Wave: 0 / WAVES    Step: 1 / N
Last completed action: Phase 1A Capture & Task Breakdown
Next action: Phase 1B Spec & Plan
Workers in flight: none
Commits: none    Pushed: no
Branch: <branch> | Tree at start: clean (or dirty with <paths>)
Tools: invoke_subagent=yes send_message=yes ask_question=yes gitmap=yes
| Task-ID | Subtask | Owner | Owned files | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Task-01 | 01-<name> | Worker 01 | <paths> | PENDING | - |
Assumptions: <list or none>
Conflicts: <list or none>
Stage list: <every path this run creates or modifies>

---

## 6. Phase 1: Planning Step & Spec Step (Steps 1 .. PHASE_1_BUDGET)

You must use `invoke_subagent` to delegate both planning and spec writing.

1. **Planning Step (A = 2 Agents):** Lead agent calls `invoke_subagent` to spawn 2 subagents (e.g., `Research 01`, `Research 02`). Their prompt MUST instruct them to research the codebase using GitMap high-speed search (`gitmap aum search "<symbol>" [dir] [-e <.ext>]`, `gitmap find`, `gitmap lf`, `gitmap cat`) — NEVER PowerShell `Select-String` or `git grep` — define the boundaries, and write the Execution Plan (`.ai-memory/plans/pending/NN-<slug>.md`) and the Root Task JSON Manifest.
   - *Tool Call:* Lead must actually execute the `invoke_subagent` tool, then print `Dispatched Planning Agents`, and then END TURN to wait for `<SYSTEM_MESSAGE>`.
2. **Spec Step (A = 2 Agents):** Once planning is done, the lead agent calls `invoke_subagent` again to spawn 2 subagents. Their prompt MUST instruct them to write the Canonical Spec (`02-spec/21-app/NN-<slug>.md` or folder) and decompose subtasks into `.ai-memory/plans/subtasks/`.
   - *Tool Call:* Lead must actually execute the `invoke_subagent` tool, then print `Dispatched Spec Agents`, and then END TURN to wait for `<SYSTEM_MESSAGE>`.
3. **Readiness Gate:** Complete Phase 1 planning and spec authoring within `PHASE_1_BUDGET` steps, then proceed **UNCONDITIONALLY** into Phase 2.

---

## 7. Phase 2: Execution Step (Worker Waves) (Steps (PHASE_1_BUDGET + 1) .. N)

> [!CRITICAL]
> **MANDATORY `invoke_subagent` DISPATCH (ZERO SOLO EXECUTION):**
> You MUST ACTUALLY CALL the `invoke_subagent` tool to spawn A workers (`TypeName: "self"`, up to H subtasks per worker) in parallel. Executing all subtasks solo in main agent without the tool call is an immediate auto-reject failure.

### 7.1 Dispatch Payload (`invoke_subagent`)

The `invoke_subagent` payload holds A entries (`Worker 01 .. Worker <A>`):

```json
{
  "Subagents": [
    {
      "TypeName": "self",
      "Role": "Worker 01: [Assigned Subtask]",
      "Model": "inherit",
      "Workspace": "inherit",
      "Prompt": "<Worker Brief Below>"
    },
    {
      "TypeName": "self",
      "Role": "Worker 02: [Assigned Subtask]",
      "Model": "inherit",
      "Workspace": "inherit",
      "Prompt": "<Worker Brief Below>"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 7.2 Self-Contained Worker Brief (Eliminate Context Blindness)

Subagents spawn with clean context. The prompt envelope MUST inject complete instructions:

```text
You are Worker <NN> for task NN-<slug>. You have no prior chat context; this brief is your complete specification.

### Boundaries:
- Read any file in the workspace; edit only your Owned Files: <relative paths>.
- Code & Symbol Search: Use GitMap exclusively: `gitmap aum search "<pattern>" [dir] [-e <.ext>] [-r] [-i]` or `gitmap search`. TOTAL BAN on PowerShell `Select-String`, `Get-ChildItem -Recurse`, `git grep`, `grep`, or `findstr`.
- After C tool calls, stop and report what you have.
- A tool failing twice: reply "STATUS: BLOCKED" with exact error and stop. Never guess paths and never troubleshoot machine.
- Workers that find a secret stop and report "BLOCKED: secret at <file>:<line>". They do not handle it themselves.
- Adhere to R1, R2, and R11 by ID.

### Assigned Subtasks (up to H subtasks):
- Subtask 1: .ai-memory/plans/subtasks/NN-<slug>/01-<name>.md
- Subtask 2: .ai-memory/plans/subtasks/NN-<slug>/02-<name>.md (if assigned)

### 100% Non-Negotiable Coding Guidelines (AUTO-REJECT ON VIOLATION):
1. Positive booleans ONLY: use `is` and `has` prefixes exclusively. NEVER evaluate explicit `== true`. NEVER combine positive and negative checks in the same condition (`if isA && !isB` is BANNED).
2. Go Structured Errors: return `*appfault.AppError`, never bare `error`.
3. Function Sizing: <= 8 lines preferred, hard cap 15 lines. Extract domain structs and raw generics to `types.go`.
4. Strict Relative Git Paths: zero absolute filesystem paths and zero `file:///` URIs.
5. Repo Secrets: if any credentials or private tokens are needed, store them in the `repo-secrets` folder in the default work directory (via `gitmap rs`). Never commit secrets.
6. Zero Builds or Tests: NEVER run `go build`, `npm run build`, `go test`, or `pytest`.
7. Targeted Verification: Run only fast file-scoped linters (e.g. `python 03-ai-scripts/05-guideline-autofixer.py <folder> --check-only`). A check scanning 0 files is a FAIL.
8. GitMap Search Primacy (TOTAL BAN on Select-String / git grep): NEVER execute PowerShell `Select-String`, `Get-ChildItem`, `git grep`, `grep`, or `findstr`. Always use `gitmap aum search "<pattern>" [dir] [-e <.ext>] [-r]` for live symbol/regex discovery.

### Output Contract:
Write your subtask output to .ai-memory/plans/subtasks/NN-<slug>/01-<name>.json and reply with this JSON block, once per subtask, then stop:
{
  "task": "Task-01",
  "status": "DONE",
  "filesChanged": ["<path1>", "<path2>"],
  "checks": "<command> -> exit <code>, <files scanned>",
  "acceptance": { "ac1": "PASS <evidence>" },
  "assumptions": [],
  "blockers": []
}
```

### 7.3 Turn-Yielding & Verification Protocol

1. **Invoke & Yield:** You must ACTUALLY CALL the `invoke_subagent` tool in your turn. Print the progress line (`Dispatched Worker 01 .. Worker <A> (wave k / WAVES); waiting for their results.`) and **STOP CALLING TOOLS** to end your turn.
2. **Verify Worker Reports Independently:** Confirm `git diff --stat -- <owned files>` matches `filesChanged`, no files outside owned files modified, re-run targeted checks for `exit 0` on non-zero files.
3. **Reject Violations:** Send failures via `send_message`. On `BLOCKED`, lead does work and logs `LEAD_FALLBACK: <reason>`. After two failed rounds, mark `FAILED`, write RCA, continue (R13).
4. **Update Ledger:** Record status, evidence, changed paths in `ledger.md` via `replace_file_content`.
5. **Loop:** Dispatch subsequent waves via `invoke_subagent` until all subtasks are `DONE` or `FAILED`.

---

## 8. Phase 3: Consolidation, Evidence Verification & Atomic GitMap Push

1. **Consolidate Subtasks:** Merge completed subtasks into `.ai-memory/plans/completed/NN-<slug>.md`, logging real steps from ledger; link to canonical spec. Delete `.ai-memory/plans/subtasks/NN-<slug>/` and pending plan. Canonical spec in `02-spec/21-app/` stays permanently.
2. **Update Registers:** Update `.ai-memory/plans/readme.md` and `02-spec/21-app/readme.md`. Update `01-prompts/readme.md` and `.ai-memory/prompts.md` only when adding/modifying prompts. Register recent completed tasks before push gate.
3. **Push Gate Verification:** Before GitMap call, verify: (a) targeted checks exit 0 (>0 files), (b) secrets gate clean, (c) `.gitignore` covers caches, build outputs, logs, reports, `.env*` (untrack any tracked ignored files via `git rm --cached <file>` or `git rm -r --cached <dir>`). On failure: abort GitMap call; mark task `FAILED` with RCA.
4. **Atomic Commit & Push:** Call `gitmap cpf "<summary>"` (features) or `gitmap cpb "<summary>"` (fixes). Push rejected: `git pull --rebase` and re-run. Miss after push: allow one follow-up `gitmap cpb "<summary>"`, logged as `FOLLOW_UP_PUSH: <sha>`. Never amend pushed commits.

---

## 9. Final Report Format (Strict Vertical Lines)

```markdown
### Task Completion Summary

- ✅ **Task-01: [Descriptive Task Title]** — `[Completed]` — [diff/check evidence]
- ❌ **Task-02: [Descriptive Task Title]** — `[Failed]` — [RCA link]

### Modified Files Summary

- [relative/path/to/modified/file1.ext]
- [relative/path/to/modified/file2.ext]

### Steps Used

- Step x / N (Phase 1: y / PHASE_1_BUDGET, Phase 2: z / PHASE_2_BUDGET), Wave k / WAVES

### Implementation Confidence Score

- Confidence: [passed checks / total checks]
- Rationale: [Verified evidence across all criteria, passing targeted linters, zero regressions]

Independent check: run /verify-parent-task-run <slug>

### 🤖 Independent AI Verification & Audit Prompt

(Emit self-contained audit prompt linking spec, plan, and modified files)
```

---

---

## 10. Targeted Verification Checks

Confirm scripts exist via harmless workspace call before invoking (R4). Run on changed files/folders only:

- **Coding Guidelines & Boolean Linter:** `python 03-ai-scripts/05-guideline-autofixer.py <folder> --check-only --ext <.ext>`
- **Relative Path Linter:** `python linter-scripts/check-relative-paths.py`
- **Prompts & Spec Index Linter:** `python linter-scripts/check-prompts-loaded.py`
- **Markdown Link & Doc Path Linter:** `python 03-ai-scripts/22-doc-path-linter.py <folder>`
- **Sequence Integrity Linter:** `python linter-scripts/check-sequence-integrity.py`
- **Forbidden Strings Check:** `python linter-scripts/check-forbidden-strings.py`

---

## 11. AI Fix Scripts Memory (Reusable Tooling)

- [ ] [/goal](slashCommand;goal) Reuse First: Scanned and learned `03-ai-scripts/readme.md` before writing temporary code.
- [ ] Strict In-Repository Execution: All Python scripts executed strictly within the codebase repository root.
- [ ] Strict .ai-memory/ Folder Storage: All helper scripts, local runners, and linters stored in `03-ai-scripts/`.
- [ ] Native File Manipulator: Use `python 03-ai-scripts/03-file-manipulator.py <command>` for mass file operations.
- [ ] Go Generate Sync: If Go constants or enums are modified, run `go generate ./...` in the relevant package and commit generated files.

---

## 12. Banned Operations Checklist (TOTAL BAN — Auto-Reject on Violation)

- [ ] TOP-INSTRUCTION PRIORITY MANDATE: Whatever directives, constraints, checklists, or instructions are given before this section or prompt (user preamble, header constraints, prior instructions) are verified as highest priority and non-negotiable, overriding all lower-level guidelines below.
- [ ] MANDATORY SUBAGENT SPAWNING GATE (ZERO SOLO EXECUTION): Verified that `invoke_subagent` (`A = 2, H = 2`) was explicitly called in Phase 1 (parallel discovery/spec modules) and Phase 2 (`TypeName: "self"` parallel subtask execution). Executing all reads or code modifications solo without calling `invoke_subagent` is an immediate auto-reject failure.
- [ ] ISSUE & RCA DESTINATION ROUTING: Whenever resolving an issue or performing a fix with RCA, verified that CI/CD failures are documented in .ai-memory/cicd-issues/NN-<slug>.md (indexed in .ai-memory/cicd-index.md), while non-CI/CD issues (application bugs, logic/runtime defects) are documented in 02-spec/22-app-issues/NN-<slug>.md (indexed in 02-spec/22-app-issues/readme.md).
- [ ] NO TEST RUNNING (TOTAL BAN): Never run any tests using Python scripts (`06-cicd-local-runner.py`, `pytest`, runner scripts), Go (`go test ./...`), or any test runner during routine execution turns. Testing is strictly checked later on in CI/CD.
- [ ] NO BUILD CHECKING (TOTAL BAN): Never run build commands (`go build`, `npm run build`, compiler checks) to verify compilation. Build verification is checked later on in CI/CD.
- [ ] NO RUNNER SCRIPTS (TOTAL BAN): Never launch background test runners, worker pools, or test inventory loops during routine execution.
- [ ] NO AUTOMATIC RELEASES (TOTAL BAN): Never bump versions, update changelogs, or trigger releases unless explicitly commanded by the user.
- [ ] NO PER-FILE COMMITTING (TOTAL BAN): Never commit each file individually as you work (e.g. running `git commit` after editing File 1, then another commit after File 2). Committing file-by-file pollutes git history, creates subagent lock collisions, and breaks atomic changes. All modified files across the turn must be accumulated and committed together in a single atomic commit at the final step.
- [ ] NO RAPID CI/CD POLLING (TOTAL BAN): Never query or loop rapidly (`gh run view` in tight loops) when inspecting remote CI/CD pipelines. Agents must query pipeline state using GitMap Pipeline-AI (`gitmap pipeline-ai status --json` or `gitmap pl-ai status -t <sec>`) and strictly wait or sleep based on `etaSeconds` to eliminate credit waste.
- [ ] NO PREMATURE TURN CLOSING BEFORE EXECUTION (TOTAL BAN): Never halt execution, conclude the turn, or ask the user for permission after generating specs or subtasks. Planning constitutes only 50% of the task budget; you must proceed unconditionally to Phase 2 code execution. (Note: When dispatching asynchronous background subagents via `invoke_subagent`, yielding control to allow platform reactive wakeup is mandatory and is exempt from this ban).
- [ ] NO HORIZONTAL TASK CONCATENATION (TOTAL BAN): Never concatenate tasks horizontally in the Task Completion Summary (e.g. NEVER `✅ #1... ✅ #2...` run-on). Every completed task MUST be rendered on its OWN SEPARATE LINE starting with an individual markdown list bullet (`- ✅`).
- [ ] INDEPENDENT AI VERIFICATION PROMPT MANDATE: Emitted the self-contained independent AI verification and audit prompt linking to the canonical spec, consolidated plan, and modified files with verbatim score audit criteria.
- [ ] GITMAP HEAVY USAGE & ROUTINE PULL BAN: Heavily leveraged GitMap commands (`cpf`, `cpb`, `cpr`, `search`, `find`, `pwsh`) for discovery, execution, and commits. Never ran `pull-all` (`gitmap pa` or `gitmap pae`) unconditionally during routine turns; only ran `gitmap pae --json` when explicitly commanded by the user.
- [ ] NO POWERSHELL OR SHELL SEARCHES (TOTAL BAN): Never run `Select-String`, `Get-ChildItem -Recurse`, `grep`, `git grep`, `findstr`, or slow shell search pipelines to search code. All code searching and symbol discovery MUST use GitMap high-speed search tools: `gitmap aum search "<query>" [dir] [-e <.ext>] [-r]` (streaming multi-core text/regex search) or `gitmap search "<query>"` (indexed symbol search). Running `Select-String` or `git grep` is an immediate auto-reject failure.

## 13. Non-Negotiable Coding Guidelines Checklist (Auto-Reject on Violation)

[/goal](slashCommand;goal) You must verify every item on this checklist before committing any code. If a subagent violated one of these rules, you must reject their work.

- [ ] Master Guidelines: Fully enforced every file in `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/` and `.ai-memory/coding-guidelines.md`.
- [ ] Concrete Types Centralization (`types.go`): Extracted domain structs, raw generic instantiations, and Result wrappers into dedicated `types.go` files as single reusable named types with follow-through comments (never leak raw generics like `result.Result[*Config]`).
- [ ] Error Management: Enforced `02-spec/03-error-manage/` using domain-specific `*appfault.AppError`, never generic error.
- [ ] Boolean Conventions: All booleans begin with is or has only (all other prefixes like can, should, was, will, did, must are banned). No negatives (`!isSuccess` is banned; use `isFail`).
- [ ] Semantic Naming: Zero generic garbage names (`temp`, `data`, `obj`). Behavior-driven unit test names.
- [ ] Multi-Line Arguments (Rule 9a/9b): Signatures and call sites with >2 arguments formatted one argument per line with trailing commas.
- [ ] Line Endings & Encoding: Strictly Unix LF (`\n`) and UTF-8 without BOM.
- [ ] Function Sizing: Functions <= 8 lines preferred (hard cap 15 lines).
- [ ] Strict Relative Git Paths: Zero absolute paths (`/absolute/path/to/...`) or `file:///` URIs.

---

## 14. Anti-Hallucination & Blast Radius Checklist

- [ ] Echo Back the Spec: Verified Acceptance Criteria from the Spec file verbatim.
- [ ] Pre-Commit Diff Proof: Verified `git status` shows actual modified files before committing.
- [ ] No Placeholder Search: Confirmed zero `TODO` or `\[.*\]` placeholders remain in modified files.
- [ ] Index Sync Deadman Switch: Every new file is explicitly linked in `readme.md` and enqueued in `.ai-memory/what-to-read.md`.
- [ ] Blast Radius Acknowledgment: Global search across codebase performed via `gitmap aum search "<symbol>" [dir]` to update all callers of modified symbols (never `Select-String` or `git grep`).
- [ ] Continuous Loop Maintained: Continuous self-loop executed until 100% complete without running banned test/build commands.
- [ ] Final Step Commit & Push Verified: Staged all changes (`git add -A`), committed everything in a single grouped atomic commit, and pushed to git before ending the turn (no per-file commits).

---

## 15. Final Step Git Commit & Push Mandate (Strict Checklist)

- [ ] MANDATORY FINAL COMMIT & PUSH VIA GITMAP (ANYHOW): At the final step of the turn, after all targeted files have been refactored, verified with targeted linters, and plans/subtasks consolidated, use GitMap semantic commit commands: `gitmap cpf "<summary>"` (features), `gitmap cpb "<summary>"` (bugs), or `gitmap cpr "<summary>"` (releases) which automatically stage, commit with standardized prefixes, and push directly to the remote repository. (Fallback to `git add -A && git commit && git push` only if GitMap CLI is unavailable). Leaving uncommitted changes or unpushed commits on the active branch at the end of a turn is an immediate failure.
- [ ] TOTAL BAN ON PER-FILE COMMITS (DO NOT COMMIT EACH FILE INDIVIDUALLY): You must not create separate git commits for each individual file as you edit them (e.g. running `git commit` or `gitmap cpf` after editing File 1, then committing again after File 2 is strictly forbidden). Committing file-by-file pollutes git log history, creates subagent lock collisions, and breaks atomic rollback. All modified files, test change caches, and plan records across the turn must be accumulated in the working tree and committed together in a single grouped atomic commit at the final step before pushing.

## MUST FOLLOW NON-NEGOTIABLE

Listen, past runs of these turns have been sloppy and stupid as fuck: wrong step counts, partial task lists dumped into chat instead of files, plans and session summaries half-filled with "[N]" placeholders, folders skimmed, open ambiguities ignored, CI/CD issues and `plans/subtasks/` forgotten, user commands dropped, coding guidelines bypassed, detailed specs chopped and summarized into useless junk, uppercase README files left uncorrected, `.ai-memory/memory/` created by accident, `strictly-avoid.md` overwritten, and explicit user instructions softened after being told not to. WTF. How on earth are you reverting to this carelessness, are you stupid?? Stop doing that, you stupid fuck. Read the whole codebase, read every folder in `02-spec/` and `.ai-memory/`, confirm root `readme.md` is strictly lowercase, find the root cause in one sentence, capture commands, issues, and pending tasks without omitting a single item, write the spec files and memory files in the right paths, update every index in the same turn, sync `readme.md` with `what-to-read.md`, preserve detailed specs verbatim with zero truncation, group commits with clear messages, and push everything to git before ending. Going deep IS the job. If you are not going deep, you are not doing the job. Violating this is auto-reject on the same tier as RULE 0. Avoid stupidity and being careless, you stupid fuck. Where is your attention, are you stupid? Tell me. Your stupidity is going on top of my head. Where did you learn this stupidity? If I could find you, I could slap you.
