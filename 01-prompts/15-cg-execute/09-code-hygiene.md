Trigger Keywords & Aliases: `cg-hygiene`, `cg-execute hygiene`, `audit hygiene`, `fix file sizes`, `enforce code hygiene`, `parameter reduction`, `fix line endings`, `fix encoding`, `enforce utf8 lf`

> **Prompt Version:** 2.1.0
> **Synchronization:** Main Meta-Repo & Connected Workspaces

```text
N = 200
```

N = total self-loop steps budget that the agents will perform.

/goal Autonomously scan, plan, refactor, and fix all code hygiene, file size, parameter bloat, LF line ending (`\n`), UTF-8 (no BOM) encoding, and trailing newline violations across the codebase, enforcing 100-line standard file caps (recommended <= 80 lines), 8–15 line function caps, specialized parameter-reducing helper functions, extracting inline types, and sanitizing build artifacts until 100% green without stopping.

### Master Task Checklist (Atomic Numbered Steps)

1. [ ] /goal Phase 1 (Step A): Deeply scan the target codebase to inventory all architectural violations and anti-patterns.
2. [ ] /goal Phase 1 (Step B): Write the master audit specification in `.ai-memory/plans/pending/` with an exhaustive Violation Ledger.
3. [ ] /goal Phase 1 (Step C): Decompose the master plan into granular, atomic subtasks in `.ai-memory/plans/subtasks/`.
4. [ ] /goal Phase 1 (Step D): Verify or create the automated quality linter and register in `03-ai-scripts/01-index.md`.
5. [ ] /goal Phase 2 (Step A): Open each target file and perform surgical refactoring following authoritative guidelines.
6. [ ] /goal Phase 2 (Step B): Enforce <= 8–15 line function decomposition, single return types, and clean formatting.
7. [ ] /goal Phase 2 (Step C): Execute local linters to verify 0 remaining violations across all modified files.
8. [ ] /goal Phase 2 (Step D): Execute targeted file-level linters and verification on modified files ensuring 0 remaining violations (`exit 0`). DO NOT run the full CI/CD pipeline runner (`06-cicd-local-runner.py`) during routine coding guideline execution turns.
9. [ ] /learn Ingest `.ai-memory/memory/01-index.md` for project memory index and past learnings.
10. [ ] /learn Ingest `.ai-memory/strictly-avoid.md` for banned anti-patterns and strict constraints.
11. [ ] /learn Ingest `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/02-canonical-size-tier.md` for canonical file and function size tiers.
12. [ ] /learn Ingest `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/01-cross-language/01-index.md` for hallucination prevention and micro-tasking.
13. [ ] /learn Ingest `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/01-cross-language/01-index.md` for strict relative path citation requirements.
14. [ ] /learn Ingest `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/08-file-folder-naming/` for lowercase naming and continuous file sequencing.
15. [ ] /learn Ingest `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/01-cross-language/04-code-style/` for domain-specific architectural specifications.
16. [ ] /learn Ingest `.ai-memory/coding-guidelines.md` for master consolidated coding guidelines.
17. [ ] /goal Create or update agent rules in the repository if missing from agent memory.

```text
PHASE_1_STEPS = N / 2   (Steps 1 .. N/2: Scan Codebase, Write .ai-memory/plans/pending/ Spec, Create .ai-memory/plans/subtasks/, Verify/Create Linter Hook)
PHASE_2_STEPS = N / 2   (Steps N/2+1 .. N: Actively Edit Code, Normalize LF & UTF-8, Remove Double Blank Lines, File & Function Splits, Local CI Runner Verification)
```

N, PHASE_1_STEPS, and PHASE_2_STEPS are read-only after initialization. Never modify them mid-execution.

## Dedicated Section: Universal File Hygiene, Line Endings & Encoding Standards (Non-Negotiable)

Every repository artifact, source file (`.go`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.py`, `.php`, `.cs`, `.js`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.yml`), and Markdown specification (`.md`) MUST strictly adhere to these universal file hygiene standards:

### 1. Unix LF (`\n`) Line Endings Only (TOTAL BAN on CRLF `\r\n`)

- **Strict LF:** Every file MUST use Unix-style line feeds (`\n`, `0x0A`).
- **Zero CRLF:** Windows-style carriage returns (`\r\n`, `0x0D 0x0A`) are strictly prohibited.
- Git and linters must verify LF across all files.

### 2. Strict UTF-8 Encoding (NO BOM)

- **UTF-8 Only:** All source code and markdown files MUST be encoded in **UTF-8 without Byte Order Mark (BOM)**.
- **BOM Banned:** Zero `\xef\xbb\xbf` header bytes. UTF-16 and UTF-32 are strictly forbidden.

### 3. Mandatory Single Trailing Newline at End of File (EOF)

- Every file MUST terminate with **exactly one newline (`\n`)** on the final line.
- Zero files missing a newline at EOF (`\ No newline at end of file` in Git diffs is an auto-reject).
- Zero multiple trailing blank lines at the end of a file (normalize to exactly one terminating newline).

### 4. No Function Starts with a Blank Line

- Every function body MUST begin writing executable code immediately on line 1 after the opening brace `{` (or `:` in Python).
- Placing an empty line as the first line of a function is strictly forbidden.

```go
// ❌ WRONG: Empty line right after opening brace
func CalculateDiscount(price float64) float64 {

    rate := getDiscountRate()
    return price * rate
}

// ✅ CORRECT: Code starts immediately on line 1; blank line before return
func CalculateDiscount(price float64) float64 {
    rate := getDiscountRate()

    return price * rate
}
```

### 5. Zero Double Blank Lines (`\n\n\n` Banned) in Code & Markdown

- There should **NEVER be two or more consecutive blank lines** anywhere inside source files or markdown documents.
- Always normalize multiple consecutive blank lines to exactly **one single blank line** (`\n\n`).

### 6. Markdown Header Spacing Rules (H1–H6: `#` through `######`)

- **Before Header:** Exactly **ONE blank line BEFORE** every markdown heading (EXCEPT when the heading is on line 1 of the file — line 1 has NO blank line before it).
- **After Header:** Exactly **ONE blank line AFTER** every markdown heading.

---

## Dedicated Section: Parameter Reduction & Specialized Helper Function Paradigm

Passing repeated constant arguments or flags across multiple call sites is a major source of code smell, parameter bloat, and boilerplate.

### Why Parameter Bloat & Repetition Is Forbidden

1. **Violates the <= 3 Parameters Limit:** Functions with excessive arguments are difficult to read, test, and maintain.
2. **Duplication of Context:** Hardcoding the same enum, flag, or code at 10 different call sites creates maintenance hazards when behavior changes.
3. **Impaired Readability:** Callers should express intent directly through semantic function names rather than passing tuples of flags and constants.

### The Specialized Helper Paradigm (Generic Example with Proper Newlines)

When a function call frequently repeats identical constants, enums, or exit codes, extract a specialized single-argument or zero-argument helper:

```go
// ❌ FORBIDDEN: Passing repeated constant/enum arguments at every call site
func ProcessPayload(data []byte) {
    if len(data) == 0 {
        reporter.ReportEvent(data, EventTypeValidationFailure, SeverityLevelError)
        return
    }

    reporter.ReportEvent(data, EventTypeProcessingSuccess, SeverityLevelInfo)
}

// ✅ REQUIRED: Specialized helper functions reducing parameter count and boilerplate
func ReportValidationError(data []byte) {
    reporter.ReportEvent(data, EventTypeValidationFailure, SeverityLevelError)
}

func ReportSuccess(data []byte) {
    reporter.ReportEvent(data, EventTypeProcessingSuccess, SeverityLevelInfo)
}

func ProcessPayload(data []byte) {
    if len(data) == 0 {
        ReportValidationError(data)
        return
    }

    ReportSuccess(data)
}
```

---

## Canonical Size Tier Reference

You MUST adhere to the single source of truth defined in `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/02-canonical-size-tier.md`:

| Metric | Limit | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|
| **Function body (preferred)** | <= 8 lines | warn |
| **Function body (hard cap)** | <= 15 lines | error (build fails) |
| **File length (standard max)** | <= 100 lines | error (coding lines) |
| **File length (recommended)** | <= 80 lines | info |
| **React component file** | <= 80–100 lines | error (max 100 lines) |
| **Struct / class** | <= 120 lines | error |
| **Nested `if` statements** | 0 (No nesting) | error (flatten with guard clauses) |
| **Function Parameters** | <= 3 parameters | error (use specialized helpers / structs) |
| **Line Endings** | LF (`\n`) only | error (CRLF auto-rejected) |
| **File Encoding** | UTF-8 (no BOM) | error (BOM auto-rejected) |
| **Double Blank Lines** | 0 (Banned) | error (normalize to 1 blank line) |

## Continuous 2-Phase Self-Loop & 2-Agent Concurrency Architecture

To guarantee full execution without stopping after planning mode, the master orchestrator MUST enforce this continuous 2-phase loop:

### 1. 2-Agent Concurrency & Strict `.ai-memory/` Bounding

- **2-Agent Limit (Max 2 Threads Each):** When dispatching work, spawn **at most 2 sub-agents concurrently**, with **no more than 2 threads per agent**.
- **Strict Folder Bounding (`.ai-memory/`):** Subagents can ONLY write planning files, subtasks, status reports, and logs inside `.ai-memory/` (`.ai-memory/plans/`, `.ai-memory/01-index.md`, `.ai-memory/memory/issues/`).
- **Context Diet:** Provide subagents with minimal instructions (e.g. "Read subtask file `.ai-memory/plans/subtasks/xx-<parent-slug>/01-<subtask-title>.md` and execute it"). Do not paste huge files into agent prompts.

### 2. Phase 1: Planning Mode & Subtask Generation (Steps 1 .. N/2)

- Spawn 2 planning subagents to scan the codebase for target guideline violations.
- Write the master architectural specification in `.ai-memory/plans/pending/xx-audit.md` with an exhaustive Violation Ledger table.
- Decompose the master plan into granular subtasks in `.ai-memory/plans/subtasks/xx-<parent-slug>/01-<subtask-title>.md`, `02-<subtask-title>.md`, etc.
- **MANDATORY AUTO-LOOP (DO NOT STOP):** Once Phase 1 planning completes, the master orchestrator **MUST NOT STOP or ask the user for confirmation**. It MUST immediately self-loop and transition directly into Phase 2 execution mode.

### 3. Phase 2: Execution Mode & Parallel Refactoring (Steps N/2+1 .. N)

- Spawn 2 execution subagents (max 2 threads each) to execute subtasks in parallel on disjoint files.
- Subagents refactor code following all coding guidelines (<= 8–15 line functions, single return types, universal `*AppError` wrapping, Unix LF line endings).
- Move completed subtasks from `.ai-memory/plans/subtasks/` to `.ai-memory/plans/completed/` and update `.ai-memory/plans/01-index.md`.
- **Failure Memory & Feedback Loop:** If a subagent fails:
  - Rollback dirty working tree and log error details to `.ai-memory/plan.md` and `.ai-memory/memory/issues/xx-failure.md`.
  - The next subagent spawned MUST read the previous failure log first, record it as a pending memory task, and implement the necessary fix.
- Execute targeted local linters on modified files ensuring `exit 0` before concluding. DO NOT run the full CI/CD pipeline runner (`06-cicd-local-runner.py`) during routine loops.

## Strict In-Repository Execution & `.ai-memory/` Bounding Mandate

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **STRICT IN-REPOSITORY EXECUTION & `.ai-memory/` STORAGE CONTRACT:**
>
> 1. **In-Codebase Execution Only:** Whenever a Python script (runner, autofixer, linter, test aggregator) is executed or created, it MUST be executed **strictly within the repository root** (current working directory), NEVER outside the codebase or against external arbitrary directories.
> 2. **Strict Folder Bounding (`.ai-memory/`):** All AI scripts, local runners, autofixers, helper utilities, memory issue logs, and planning files MUST be created inside the `.ai-memory/` folder:
>    - Python AI Scripts: `03-ai-scripts/` (e.g. `01-file-manipulator.py`, `05-guideline-autofixer.py`, `06-cicd-local-runner.py`, `07-relative-path-fixer.py`, `05-naming-autofixer.py`).
>    - RCA & Issue Logs: `.ai-memory/memory/issues/` and `.ai-memory/cicd-issues/`.
>    - Execution Plans & Subtasks: `.ai-memory/plans/pending/`, `.ai-memory/plans/subtasks/`.
>    - Coding Guidelines Mirror: `.ai-memory/coding-guidelines.md`.
> 3. **Worker Pool & Log Aggregation Architecture:** All local runners and test orchestrators must use a concurrent worker pool (2–3 workers via `ThreadPoolExecutor`), announce enqueued tasks upfront, show real-time progress, handle failures gracefully without canceling sibling workers, and print a consolidated final summary with full stdout/stderr error logs for failed jobs.
> 4. **`force` Keyword Support:** If the user wrote `force`, `force rebuild`, or `force create` on top of the prompt or trigger: **ALWAYS recreate/regenerate the Python runner script from scratch**, regardless of whether the file already exists on disk.
> 5. **No External or Random File Creation:** NEVER write scripts, temporary test scripts, or scratch files to root, `/tmp`, global system paths, or outside the repository boundary.
> 6. **GitHub Actions Zero Storage (Rule R18):** Never use `actions/upload-artifact` in CI workflows (`ci.yml`, matrix builds, linter runs). Free tier accounts have an account-wide cap of 0.5 GB (500 MB). CI runs must remain completely ephemeral. Releases belong exclusively in GitHub Releases (`release.yml`), never in Actions artifact storage.

## AI Fix Scripts Memory (Reusable Tooling)

- [ ] `/goal` **Reuse First:** I have rigorously scanned and `/learn`ed `03-ai-scripts/01-index.md` to check if a helper script already exists before writing any new temporary code.
- [ ] **Strict In-Repository Execution:** All Python scripts (`03-ai-scripts/*.py`) MUST be executed strictly within the codebase repository root, NEVER outside the codebase.
- [ ] **Strict .ai-memory/ Folder Storage:** All AI scripts, local runners, autofixers, and helper utilities MUST be created inside `03-ai-scripts/`. NEVER create scripts in root or external paths.
- [ ] **Automated File & Hygiene Fixer:** Use `python 03-ai-scripts/03-file-manipulator.py` and `05-guideline-autofixer.py` to normalize LF endings, remove trailing whitespace, and fix file size boundaries.
- [ ] **Go Generate Sync:** If you modify Go constants, enums, or stringers, you MUST run `go generate ./...` in the relevant directory (e.g., `cd gitmap && go generate ./...`) and commit the resulting generated files to prevent CI drift.
- [ ] **Commit & Track:** All new helper scripts were written strictly to `03-ai-scripts/` and committed to Git for future reuse.
- [ ] **Index Documentation:** I have updated `03-ai-scripts/01-index.md` using sequential script naming (e.g., `01-file-manipulator.py`). For every script, I have included a `<details>` collapsible tag explaining exactly why the script is there and what it does.

---

## Pre-Reply / Loop Checklist (Must Verify Every Loop Iteration)

- [ ] Git working tree is clean before new code changes.
- [ ] Sub-agents are actively assigned disjoint files verified against `.ai-memory/01-index.md`.
- [ ] Completed tasks were `mv`'d to `plans/completed/` and `.ai-memory/plans/01-index.md` was updated.
- [ ] 3-strike rule respected: failed tasks cleanly rolled back and logged to `last-failure.md`.
- [ ] **Strict Relative Git Paths:** All file paths, markdown links, citations, and subtask references in plans, specs, and memory logs are strictly relative to the git repository root. Zero absolute paths (`/absolute/path/to/...`, `/absolute/path/to/...`) or `file:///` URIs.
- [ ] **LF Line Endings (`\n`):** All files use Unix LF line endings. Zero CRLF (`\r\n`).
- [ ] **UTF-8 Encoding (No BOM):** All files encoded in UTF-8 without BOM.
- [ ] **Single Trailing Newline:** Every file ends with exactly one terminating newline (`\n`).
- [ ] **No Function Starts with Blank Line:** Functions start immediately on line 1 with code.
- [ ] **Zero Double Blank Lines:** No `\n\n\n` in code or markdown.
- [ ] **Markdown Heading Spacing:** Exactly one blank line before and after headings (no leading blank line on line 1).
- [ ] **File Size Caps:** All files <= 100 coding lines (recommended <= 80 lines).
- [ ] **Function Sizing:** All functions <= 8 lines preferred (hard cap 15 lines).
- [ ] Coding Guidelines & Master Consolidated File: I have fully read, checked, and strictly enforced every file in `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/`, as well as the master consolidated coding guideline file at `.ai-memory/coding-guidelines.md`.

1. [ ] /learn and apply as a /goal `.ai-memory/coding-guidelines.md` and also make sure the agent rules are created in the repo to read in the future quickly.

- [ ] `python linter-scripts/check-file-sizes.py` and `python linter-scripts/check-newline-styling.py` exited with code 0.
- [ ] **Atomic File Recording:** Modified files recorded to `.ai-memory/temp/recent-file-changes.json` under lock (`python 03-ai-scripts/33-test-inventory-generator.py --record <files...>`). Builds, tests, and CI runner are deferred to CI/CD fix.

## Non-Negotiable Coding Guidelines Checklist (Auto-Reject on Violation)

/goal You MUST verify every item on this checklist before committing any code. If a subagent violated one of these rules, you must reject their work.

- [ ] Strict Relative Git Paths: All file paths, markdown links, citations, and subtask references in plans, specs, and memory logs are strictly relative to the git repository root. Zero absolute paths or `file:///` URIs.
- [ ] Master Guidelines: I have fully read and strictly enforced `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/02-canonical-size-tier.md`, `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/08-file-folder-naming/`, and `.ai-memory/coding-guidelines.md`.
- [ ] LF Line Endings & UTF-8 (No BOM): Verified Unix LF and UTF-8 across all files.
- [ ] Boolean Principles & IsDefined: Positive prefixes only (`is`/`has`). MANDATORY: Use `isDefined` (or `res.IsDefined()`) instead of inverted empty checks (`!isEmpty` / `!res.IsEmpty()`). Never write `if !isEmpty`. Map lookups use `val, isFound := userMap[id]` or `val, isUserExist := userMap[id]`.
- [ ] GitHub Actions Zero Storage (Rule R18): Never use `actions/upload-artifact` in CI workflows; maintain zero Actions storage usage.

1. [ ] /learn the section as a /goal [AI Fix Scripts Memory](#ai-fix-scripts-memory)

- [ ] Action Summary: I have output a detailed `- [x]` checklist summarizing exactly what I accomplished this turn to prove I did not hallucinate.

---

## Mandatory Linter & CI/CD Integration

1. **Linter Scripts:** `linter-scripts/check-file-sizes.py`, `linter-scripts/check-newline-styling.py`, `linter-scripts/check-markdown-header-spacing.py`
2. **Local Run Command:** `python linter-scripts/check-file-sizes.py`
3. **Autofixer Command:** `python 03-ai-scripts/03-file-manipulator.py`
4. **CI/CD Integration (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):**
   ```yaml
   - name: Validate Code Hygiene, Line Endings & Sizes
     run: |
       python linter-scripts/check-file-sizes.py
       python linter-scripts/check-newline-styling.py
       python linter-scripts/check-markdown-header-spacing.py
   ```
5. **Runner Registration (`03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py`):**
   ```python
   JOBS = {
       "File Sizes Check": [sys.executable, "linter-scripts/check-file-sizes.py"],
       "Newline Styling Check": [sys.executable, "linter-scripts/check-newline-styling.py"],
       "Markdown Header Check": [sys.executable, "linter-scripts/check-markdown-header-spacing.py"],
   }
   ```

---

## Banned Operations Checklist (TOTAL BAN — Auto-Reject on Violation)

- [ ] **NO TEST RUNNING (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER run any tests using Python scripts (`06-cicd-local-runner.py`, `pytest`, runner scripts), Go (`go test ./...`), or any test runner during routine execution turns. Testing is strictly checked later on in CI/CD.
- [ ] **NO BUILD CHECKING (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER run build commands (`go build`, `npm run build`, compiler checks) to verify compilation. Build verification is checked later on in CI/CD.
- [ ] **NO RUNNER SCRIPTS (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER launch background test runners, worker pools, or test inventory loops during routine execution.
- [ ] **NO AUTOMATIC RELEASES (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER bump versions, update changelogs, or trigger releases unless explicitly commanded by the user.
- [ ] **NO PER-FILE COMMITTING (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER commit each file individually as you work (e.g. running `git commit` after editing File 1, then another commit after File 2). Committing file-by-file pollutes git history, creates subagent lock collisions, and breaks atomic changes. All modified files across the turn must be accumulated and committed together in a single atomic commit at the final step.

---

## Final Step Git Commit & Push Mandate (Strict Checklist)

- [ ] **MANDATORY FINAL COMMIT & PUSH TO GIT (ANYHOW):** At the FINAL step of the turn, after all targeted files have been refactored, verified with targeted linters, and plans/subtasks consolidated, you MUST stage everything (`git add -A`), create a clean, descriptive conventional commit (`git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <summary>"`), and push directly to the remote repository (`git push origin <branch>`). Leaving uncommitted changes or unpushed commits on the active branch at the end of a turn is an immediate failure.
- [ ] **TOTAL BAN ON PER-FILE COMMITS (DO NOT COMMIT EACH FILE INDIVIDUALLY):** You MUST NOT create separate git commits for each individual file as you edit them (e.g. running `git commit` after editing File 1, then committing again after File 2 is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN). Committing file-by-file pollutes git log history, creates subagent lock collisions, and breaks atomic rollback/bisectability. All modified files, test change caches, and plan records across the turn MUST be accumulated in the working tree and committed together in a SINGLE grouped atomic commit at the final step before pushing!

---

## Strictly Avoid: No Automatic Releases, No Test Running & No Full CI/CD Runner in Routine Turns (Strict Policy)

- **NO BUILD CHECKING (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER run build commands (`go build`, `npm run build`, compiler checks) to verify compilation. Build verification is checked later on in CI/CD.
- **NO RELEASES (Strict Policy):** You MUST NOT bump versions, update changelogs, or cut a release at the end of this task. Commits must remain standard development commits. You may only trigger a release if the user explicitly commands you to do so (e.g., "cut a release" or "bump the version").
- **NO TEST RUNNING (Strict Policy):** Test execution is strictly disabled. You MUST NOT execute unit tests, integration tests, or test suites unless explicitly commanded by the repository owner.
- **NO FULL CI/CD RUNNER (Strict Policy):** DO NOT run `python 03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py` during routine coding guideline execution turns. Running the heavy 28-38 gate pipeline across the entire repository wastes massive amounts of time and scans unrelated files. Verify code strictly using targeted file-level linters / autofixers on the specific modified files.
- **Test Inventory & Recent Changes Tracking:** Whenever any file is modified, append its repository-relative path to `.ai-memory/temp/recent-file-changes.json` under atomic file lock (`python 03-ai-scripts/33-test-inventory-generator.py --record <path>`), cross-referencing `.ai-memory/test-inventory.json` so associated tests are known for future release verification.
