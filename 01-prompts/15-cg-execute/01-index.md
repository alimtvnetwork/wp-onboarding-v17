# Coding Guideline Execution Suite (`cg-execute`) — Index & Catalog (must follow)

> **Prompt Version:** 2.1.0
> **Synchronization:** Main Meta-Repo & Connected Workspaces

```text
N = 200
```

N = total self-loop steps budget that the agents will perform.

/goal Autonomously orchestrate and execute coding standard compliance across the repository by directly scanning files, generating verifiable audit specs, actively refactoring source code, and verifying with automated linters until 100% green without stopping.

### Master Task Checklist (Atomic Numbered Steps)

1. [ ] /goal Phase 1 (Step A): Deeply scan the target codebase to inventory all architectural violations and anti-patterns.
2. [ ] /goal Phase 1 (Step B): Write the master audit specification in `.ai-memory/plans/pending/` with an exhaustive Violation Ledger.
3. [ ] /goal Phase 1 (Step C): Decompose the master plan into granular, atomic subtasks in `.ai-memory/plans/subtasks/`.
4. [ ] /goal Phase 1 (Step D): Verify or create the automated quality linter and register in `03-ai-scripts/01-index.md`.
5. [ ] /goal Phase 2 (Step A): Open each target file and perform surgical refactoring following authoritative guidelines.
6. [ ] /goal Phase 2 (Step B): Enforce <= 8–15 line function decomposition, single return types, and clean formatting.
7. [ ] /goal Phase 2 (Step C): Execute local linters to verify 0 remaining violations across all modified files.
8. [ ] /goal Phase 2 (Step D): Execute targeted file-level linters and verification on modified files ensuring 0 remaining violations (`exit 0`). DO NOT run the full CI/CD pipeline runner (`06-cicd-local-runner.py`) during routine coding guideline execution turns.
9. [ ] /learn Ingest `.ai-memory/memory/01-index.md` for project memory index and past learnings.
10. [ ] /learn Ingest `.ai-memory/strictly-avoid.md` for banned anti-patterns and strict constraints.

## Canonical Sizing Tier & Formatting Rules

- **Standard File Size:** Max 100 coding lines per file (recommended <= 80 lines).
- **Functions:** Target <= 8 lines of body logic; hard cap of <= 15 lines.
- **React Components:** Recommended <= 80 lines; standard max <= 100 lines.
- **Nested `if` Statements:** Zero tolerance (must be flattened with guard clauses).
- **NO Line-Compression Cheating:** Never collapse `if/else` onto a single line or delete blank lines to fit under line caps. Reduce size by decomposing into separate files.

---

## Anti-Hallucination & Verifiable Execution Protocol (Zero-Drift Mandate)

> [!CAUTION]
> **TOTAL BAN ON GHOST DIFFS, CODE TRUNCATION, AND FABRICATED PASSES:**
> AI agents frequently hallucinate progress by outputting chat diffs without modifying disk, omitting violations from memory, or inserting lazy stubs (`// ... rest of code ...`). Every step must be mechanically grounded in disk reality.

### 1. The Exhaustive Violation Ledger (Phase 1 Mandate)

- Phase 1 audit plans (`.ai-memory/plans/pending/XX-*-audit.md`) MUST include a markdown table tracking every single violation:
  `| Violation Id | File Path | Line Number | Exact Snippet | Planned Fix | Status (PENDING/DONE) |`
- Never group files into vague summaries like "various files in pkg/". Every file and line must be explicitly numbered.

### 2. The Disk Reality Verification Gate (Phase 2 Mandate)

- Before claiming a file was refactored, the agent MUST run `git status --porcelain` or `git diff --stat`.
- If a file claimed as modified does NOT show as modified on disk in git, the turn is an immediate hallucination failure.

### 3. Absolute Ban on Code Truncation & Stubs

- NEVER write placeholder comments like `// ... existing code ...`, `/* unchanged */`, `TODO`, `FIXME`, or `[N]`.
- All file edits MUST be 100% complete and functionally working.

### 4. Grounded Command Veracity

- NEVER claim a linter or test suite passed without executing the actual command via tool calls and capturing `exit code 0`. Fabricating test outputs results in an immediate strike.

### 5. Spec Citation & Relative Git Path Requirement (TOTAL BAN on Absolute Paths / `file:///` URIs)

- Every refactoring action, plan file (`.ai-memory/plans/pending/`), subtask (`.ai-memory/plans/subtasks/`), and memory log must cite the authoritative specification path from `02-spec/` or `.ai-memory/` using **strictly relative paths from the git root**.
- **TOTAL BAN:** NEVER write absolute filesystem paths (`/absolute/path/to/...`, `/absolute/path/to/...`, `/home/...`) or absolute file URIs (`file:///absolute/path/to/...`, `file:///absolute/path/to/...`) into any committed or created files.
  - ❌ **BAD:** `[SSH Commands](file:///absolute/path/to/...)`
  - ❌ **BAD:** `Target: file:///absolute/path/to/gitmap/cmd/login.go`
  - ✅ **GOOD:** `[SSH Commands](02-spec/13-generic-cli/01-index.md)`
  - ✅ **GOOD:** `Target: gitmap/cmd/login.go`

---

## Standardized N-Step Self-Loop Architecture

Every prompt in this suite operates using a strict two-phase loop budget:

### Phase 1: Scan, Spec & Subtasks (Steps 1 to N/2)

1. **Memory Ingestion:** Ingest `.ai-memory/coding-guidelines.md`, `.ai-memory/strictly-avoid.md`, and recent issues in `.ai-memory/memory/issues/`.
2. **High-Speed Violation Scan:** Run `python 03-ai-scripts/11-fast-file-scanner.py --check` and `python 03-ai-scripts/12-fast-cached-grep.py "<pattern>"` to detect AST violations across the codebase in milliseconds.
3. **Master Spec Creation:** Write `.ai-memory/plans/pending/xx-<slug>-audit.md` capturing the full violation ledger, affected files, line numbers, and acceptance criteria.
4. **Subtask Decomposition:** Break down the master plan into granular subtasks in `.ai-memory/plans/subtasks/xx-<slug>/01-<subtask-title>.md`, `02-<subtask-title>.md`, etc.
5. **Linter Hook Verification:** Check if the automated linter script exists in `linter-scripts/`. If missing, generate the linter script and connect it to `03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py` and CI/CD pipelines.

### Phase 2: Autonomous Code Refactoring & Verification (Steps N/2+1 to N)

1. **Autofixer-First Execution:** Run deterministic AST autofixers first on target files (`05-guideline-autofixer.py`, `08-naming-autofixer.py`, `04-newline-fixer.py`, `07-relative-path-fixer.py`) to automatically resolve 80-90% of mechanical violations.
2. **Cognitive Refactoring:** Agent performs surgical architectural refactoring on the remaining complex logic (<= 8–15 line functions, single return types, `*AppError` envelopes).
3. **Linter Verification & File Recording:** Execute targeted file-level linters/autofixers on specifically modified files (`exit 0`). Atomically record all modified files into `.ai-memory/temp/recent-file-changes.json` under lock (`python 03-ai-scripts/33-test-inventory-generator.py --record <files...>`). DO NOT run `06-cicd-local-runner.py`, build checks, or test suites during routine execution turns (deferred to CI/CD).
4. **Automated Plan Consolidation:** Run `python 03-ai-scripts/20-plan-consolidator.py` to archive completed subtasks and update `.ai-memory/plans/01-index.md`.
5. **Final Step Stage, Commit & Push:** Group all accumulated changes into a single clean atomic commit at the final step (e.g. `refactor(guidelines): enforce <section> rules`) and push to the remote git branch (`git push origin <branch>`). Do NOT commit files individually.

---

## Mandatory Linter & CI/CD Integration Contract

Every prompt in this suite enforces that code standards must be mechanically verified by automated tooling:

1. **Specific Linter Script:** Each prompt names the exact relative path in `linter-scripts/` responsible for validating its rules.
2. **Auto-Creation Mandate:** If the linter script does not exist, the executing agent is strictly commanded to create it using Python/Node.js/Go.
3. **Local Execution:** The prompt provides the exact local command to execute the linter with zero external overhead.
4. **CI/CD Integration:** The prompt provides the exact configuration snippet to wire the linter script into `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and register it inside `06-cicd-local-runner.py` under the `JOBS` dictionary.

---

## Banned Operations Checklist (TOTAL BAN — Auto-Reject on Violation)

- [ ] **NO TEST RUNNING (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER run any tests using Python scripts (`06-cicd-local-runner.py`, `pytest`, runner scripts), Go (`go test ./...`), or any test runner during routine execution turns. Testing is strictly checked later on in CI/CD.
- [ ] **NO BUILD CHECKING (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER run build commands (`go build`, `npm run build`, compiler checks) to verify compilation. Build verification is checked later on in CI/CD.
- [ ] **NO RUNNER SCRIPTS (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER launch background test runners, worker pools, or test inventory loops during routine execution.
- [ ] **NO AUTOMATIC RELEASES (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER bump versions, update changelogs, or trigger releases unless explicitly commanded by the user.
- [ ] **NO PER-FILE COMMITTING (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER commit each file individually as you work (e.g. running `git commit` after editing File 1, then another commit after File 2). Committing file-by-file pollutes git history, creates subagent lock collisions, and breaks atomic changes. All modified files across the turn must be accumulated and committed together in a single atomic commit at the final step.

---

## Strictly Avoid: No Automatic Releases, No Test Running & No Full CI/CD Runner in Routine Turns (Strict Policy)

- **NO BUILD CHECKING (TOTAL BAN):** NEVER run build commands (`go build`, `npm run build`, compiler checks) to verify compilation. Build verification is checked later on in CI/CD.
- **NO RELEASES (Strict Policy):** You MUST NOT bump versions, update changelogs, or cut a release at the end of this task. Commits must remain standard development commits. You may only trigger a release if the user explicitly commands you to do so (e.g., "cut a release" or "bump the version").
- **NO TEST RUNNING (Strict Policy):** Test execution is strictly disabled. You MUST NOT execute unit tests, integration tests, or test suites unless explicitly commanded by the repository owner.
- **NO FULL CI/CD RUNNER (Strict Policy):** DO NOT run `python 03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py` during routine coding guideline execution turns. Running the heavy 28-38 gate pipeline across the entire repository wastes massive amounts of time and scans unrelated files. Verify code strictly using targeted file-level linters / autofixers on the specific modified files.
- **Test Inventory & Recent Changes Tracking:** Whenever any file is modified, append its repository-relative path to `.ai-memory/temp/recent-file-changes.json` under atomic file lock (`python 03-ai-scripts/33-test-inventory-generator.py --record <path>`), cross-referencing `.ai-memory/test-inventory.json` so associated tests are known for future release verification.

## STRICT AVOIDANCE: Anti-Compression & Formatting Integrity (No Cheating)

> [!CAUTION]
> **TOTAL BAN ON LINE-COMPRESSION CHEATING:**
> When enforcing file size (<= 100 coding lines) and function size (8–15 lines), AI agents frequently attempt to "cheat" the line counter by destroying formatting. This is strictly forbidden and results in immediate rejection.

- **NO Single-Line If/Else:** NEVER collapse `if/else`, return statements, or blocks into a single line (e.g. `if (x) return y;` or `if (x) { y(); }` are strictly forbidden). Every statement requires its own line and curly braces.
- **NO Deleting Required Blank Lines (R13-R16):** NEVER delete blank lines before `return`/`throw` or after closing `}` to artificially reduce file size.
- **NO Stripping Types or Comments:** NEVER remove TypeScript types, docstrings, or clean indentation to cram code into fewer lines.
- **Mandatory Solution:** The ONLY acceptable way to satisfy line limits is **legitimate modular decomposition** — extracting helper functions into separate files and breaking large components into child components.

---

## Final Step Git Commit & Push Mandate (Strict Checklist)

- [ ] **MANDATORY FINAL COMMIT & PUSH TO GIT (ANYHOW):** At the FINAL step of the turn, after all targeted files have been refactored, verified with targeted linters, and plans/subtasks consolidated, you MUST stage everything (`git add -A`), create a clean, descriptive conventional commit (`git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <summary>"`), and push directly to the remote repository (`git push origin <branch>`). Leaving uncommitted changes or unpushed commits on the active branch at the end of a turn is an immediate failure.
- [ ] **TOTAL BAN ON PER-FILE COMMITS (DO NOT COMMIT EACH FILE INDIVIDUALLY):** You MUST NOT create separate git commits for each individual file as you edit them (e.g. running `git commit` after editing File 1, then committing again after File 2 is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN). Committing file-by-file pollutes git log history, creates subagent lock collisions, and breaks atomic rollback/bisectability. All modified files, test change caches, and plan records across the turn MUST be accumulated in the working tree and committed together in a SINGLE grouped atomic commit at the final step before pushing!

## Continuous 2-Phase Self-Loop & 2-Agent Concurrency Architecture

To guarantee full execution without stopping after planning mode, the master orchestrator MUST enforce this continuous 2-phase loop:

### 1. 2-Agent Concurrency & Strict `.ai-memory/` Bounding

- **2-Agent Limit (Max 2 Threads Each):** When dispatching work, spawn **at most 2 sub-agents concurrently**, with **no more than 2 threads per agent**.
- **Strict Folder Bounding (`.ai-memory/`):** Subagents can ONLY write planning files, subtasks, status reports, and logs inside `.ai-memory/` (`.ai-memory/plans/`, `.ai-memory/01-index.md`, `.ai-memory/memory/issues/`).
- **Context Diet:** Provide subagents with minimal instructions (e.g. "Read subtask file `.ai-memory/plans/subtasks/xx-<parent-slug>/01-<subtask-title>.md` and execute it"). Do not paste huge files into agent prompts.

### 2. Phase 1: Planning Mode & Subtask Generation (Steps 1 .. N/2)

- Spawn 2 planning subagents to scan the codebase for target guideline violations.
- Write the master architectural specification in `.ai-memory/plans/pending/xx-audit.md` with an exhaustive Violation Ledger table.
- Decompose the master plan into granular subtasks in `.ai-memory/plans/subtasks/xx-<parent-slug>/01-<subtask-title>.md`, `02-<subtask-title>.md`, etc.
- **MANDATORY AUTO-LOOP (DO NOT STOP):** Once Phase 1 planning completes, the master orchestrator **MUST NOT STOP or ask the user for confirmation**. It MUST immediately self-loop and transition directly into Phase 2 execution mode.

### 3. Phase 2: Execution Mode & Parallel Refactoring (Steps N/2+1 .. N)

- Spawn 2 execution subagents (max 2 threads each) to execute subtasks in parallel on disjoint files.
- Subagents refactor code following all coding guidelines (<= 8–15 line functions, single return types, universal `*AppError` wrapping, Unix LF line endings).
- Move completed subtasks from `.ai-memory/plans/subtasks/` to `.ai-memory/plans/completed/` and update `.ai-memory/plans/01-index.md`.
- **Failure Memory & Feedback Loop:** If a subagent fails:
  - Rollback dirty working tree and log error details to `.ai-memory/plan.md` and `.ai-memory/memory/issues/xx-failure.md`.
  - The next subagent spawned MUST read the previous failure log first, record it as a pending memory task, and implement the necessary fix.
- Execute targeted local linters on modified files ensuring `exit 0` before concluding. DO NOT run the full CI/CD pipeline runner (`06-cicd-local-runner.py`) during routine loops.
