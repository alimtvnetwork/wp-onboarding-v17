# Release-Triggered CI/CD Fix Loop — Workflow (must follow)

Trigger Keywords & Aliases: `fix and release`, `ci release`, `fix CI/CD and release`, `cicd fix release`

> **Prompt Version:** 2.1.0
> **Synchronization:** Main Meta-Repo & Connected Workspaces

```text
N = 200
```

N = total self-loop steps budget. The user may override this number when triggering the prompt.

### Master Task Checklist (Atomic Numbered Steps)

1. [ ] /goal First `N/2` steps (Phase 1): Review the central CI/CD pipeline definitions (`.github/workflows`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, etc.) and cross-reference them with the local Python runner (`03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py`).
   - **Condition:** If `03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py` does not exist, you must create it immediately.
   - **Condition:** You must ensure that **every single CI/CD case** that needs to run in the pipeline can also be run locally from this Python script (with Docker stripped for native host execution). Improve the Python script to cover all cases if any are missing.
2. [ ] /goal Second `N/2` steps (Phase 2): Run the local runner script (`python 03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py --all`) to catch all errors. Singly execute the script in an autonomous self-loop, zeroing in on one failing error per turn (4-part RCA -> surgical fix -> guideline autofixer -> re-verify).
3. [ ] /goal Finalize CI/CD: Your ultimate goal is to fix and finalize the CI/CD. You must loop until the Python local runner script executes flawlessly with **no errors** (exit code 0) for all registered cases.
4. [ ] /goal Once Phase 2 exits green, proceed immediately to Phase 3: Final Verification, then Phase 4: Release (version bump, changelog update, git tag, Quick Install one-liners, push, and release creation) using `03-ai-scripts/29-release-orchestrator.py`.
5. [ ] /learn Ingest `.lovable/cicd-issues/` for domain-specific architectural specifications.
6. [ ] /learn Ingest `.lovable/strictly-avoid.md` for banned anti-patterns and strict constraints.
7. [ ] /learn Ingest `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/02-canonical-size-tier.md` for canonical file and function size tiers.
8. [ ] /learn Ingest `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/01-cross-language/01-index.md` for hallucination prevention and micro-tasking.
9. [ ] /learn Ingest `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/01-cross-language/01-index.md` for strict relative path citation requirements.
10. [ ] /learn Ingest `02-spec/03-error-manage/` for error handling architectures and AppError.
11. [ ] /goal Create or update agent rules in the repository if missing from agent memory.

```text
PHASE_1_STEPS = N / 2   (Steps 1 .. N/2: Screenshot Pipeline Discovery, Update 06-cicd-local-runner.py, Register New JOBS)
PHASE_2_STEPS = N / 2   (Steps N/2+1 .. N: Singly-Done Self-Loop Fixing, Zero in on Errors, 4-Part RCA, Green Gate Verification)
```

N, PHASE_1_STEPS, and PHASE_2_STEPS are read-only after the user sets them. Never change them mid-execution.

> [!CAUTION]
> **This prompt includes an automated release.** The version bump and GitHub/GitLab release creation WILL run automatically at the end. Only use this prompt when you are ready to publish a new version.

## Phase 0: Antigravity Skill Bootstrap (Memory Optimization)

Before any execution, check if `.agents/skills/ci-cd-fix/skill.md` exists. If it does NOT exist, create it now with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: ci-cd-fix
description: >-
  Use this skill to autonomously diagnose, fix, and verify CI/CD pipelines using local runner scripts, 4-part RCA, and self-looping.
---
```

---

## Strict In-Repository Execution & `.lovable/` Bounding Mandate

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **STRICT IN-REPOSITORY EXECUTION & `.lovable/` STORAGE CONTRACT:**
>
> 1. **In-Codebase Execution Only:** Whenever a Python script (runner, autofixer, linter, test aggregator) is executed or created, it MUST be executed **strictly within the repository root** (current working directory), NEVER outside the codebase or against external arbitrary directories.
> 2. **Strict Folder Bounding (`.lovable/`):** All AI scripts, local runners, autofixers, helper utilities, memory issue logs, and planning files MUST be created inside the `.lovable/` folder:
>    - Python AI Scripts: `03-ai-scripts/` (e.g. `01-file-manipulator.py`, `05-guideline-autofixer.py`, `06-cicd-local-runner.py`).
>    - RCA & Issue Logs: `.lovable/memory/issues/` and `.lovable/cicd-issues/`.
>    - Execution Plans & Subtasks: `.lovable/plans/pending/`, `.lovable/plans/subtasks/`.
>    - Coding Guidelines Mirror: `.lovable/coding-guidelines.md`.
> 3. **Strict Relative Git Paths (TOTAL BAN on Absolute Paths / `file:///` URIs):** All file paths, markdown links, citations, and subtask paths inside plans, RCA logs (`.lovable/memory/issues/`), scripts, and code comments MUST be strictly relative paths from the git root (e.g., `02-spec/03-error-manage/01-index.md`, `.lovable/plans/01-index.md`, `cmd/main.go`). NEVER write absolute OS paths (`/absolute/path/to/...`, `/absolute/path/to/...`, `/home/...`) or absolute file URIs (`file:///...`).
>    - ❌ **BAD:** `[SSH Commands](file:///absolute/path/to/...)`
>    - ✅ **GOOD:** `[SSH Commands]`02-spec/13-generic-cli/01-index.md)`
> 4. **No External or Random File Creation:** NEVER write scripts, temporary test scripts, or scratch files to root, `/tmp`, global system paths, or outside the repository boundary.
> 5. **Cross-Platform Python CI Mandate (TOTAL BAN on new `.sh` scripts in CI):** All newly created or refactored CI/CD verification tools, determinism checks, fixtures, and linter jobs MUST be implemented in pure, cross-platform Python (`.py`). Legacy `.sh` scripts must be converted to `.py` scripts so all pipelines run natively across Linux, macOS, and Windows without relying on bash emulation.
> 6. **Temp & Failure Folder Isolation:** All temporary directories, runner caches, and test artifacts MUST be strictly placed in `.lovable/temp/`. Creating `.tmp/` at the repository root or outside `.lovable/` is strictly forbidden.
>    - Dedicated Failure Directory: `.lovable/temp/failures/` is the dedicated folder where failed tests and failed quality gates write error logs (`<test-or-job-name>.log`).
>    - Passing Tests Completely Silent: Passing tests must produce ZERO filesystem artifacts (zero files written) and remain completely silent in output logs.
> 7. **Runner In-Flight ETA Wait Protocol:** When running background commands, the runner dynamically writes live status and remaining ETA to `.lovable/temp/runner-eta.json` (emitting in-flight heartbeats strictly every 25 seconds or more). If an agent inspects an active background job and it is still running, the agent MUST sleep/wait for **1 minute (60 seconds) each time**, or dynamically sleep for the remaining ETA duration read from `.lovable/temp/runner-eta.json` (or based on previous total approximate delay) instead of busy-polling or querying in loops.
> 8. **Centralized Test Inventory & Incremental Caching:** All unit tests are cataloged in `.lovable/test-inventory.json` with strictly repository-relative paths (`target_file`, `test_file`). First run executes all tests to establish baseline timings; subsequent runs execute incrementally only if target code files or test files change. Slow test threshold defaults to `4.0s` (configurable via `GITMAP_SLOW_TEST_THRESHOLD`).
> 9. **Dual-Queue Worker Pools:** Slow tests run in a dedicated 4-worker pool running at most 2 tests at a time per batch. Fast tests run in a 4-worker pool running at most 4 tests at a time, pulling in chunks of 100 tests from the test inventory queue until all are complete.
> 10. **Dynamic ETA Sleep Protocol:** The AI agent reads `.lovable/temp/runner-eta.json`, sleeps for the estimated wait time rather than looping, and if still active upon waking, re-checks remaining ETA and sleeps again to avoid burning tokens.
> 11. **Zero-Storage GitHub Actions Mandate (Total Ban on CI Artifact Uploads):** Workflows MUST NOT upload test outputs, coverage files, Playwright reports, or drift summaries via `actions/upload-artifact`. Free-tier accounts have a strict 0.5 GB shared quota across all repositories. All reports, failures, and summaries MUST be emitted directly to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`, console stdout (`cat log.txt`), or sticky PR comments with zero storage consumption. Only true GitHub release assets (binaries/tarballs on tagged releases) are permitted.

---

## Screenshot & Pipeline Discovery Protocol (Execute First When Any Image Is Provided)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **If the user provides any image — a CI/CD dashboard, a pipeline run view, a failure screenshot, or a log screenshot — you MUST process it FIRST before modifying application code.**
> Images are first-class diagnostic input. Treat every pixel of text in the image as ground truth.

### Bounded Single-Step Self-Loop Sequence (Singly Done — No Overloaded Steps)

Every step must be **singly done** using bounded self-looping turns. Do NOT try to do scanning, fixing, updating runner, and releasing in a single turn.

- **Self-Loop Step 1 (Extract Pipeline Name from Screenshot):**
  1. Carefully read the image to extract:
     - The **pipeline or workflow name** (e.g. `"build-and-test"`, `"CI / lint"`, `"Deploy to staging"`, `"test-matrix"`).
     - The **failing job/step name** (marked with ❌ or "Failure").
     - The **error text, log snippets, or stack traces** visible in the screenshot.
  2. Scan repository CI/CD files (`.github/workflows/*.yml`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, etc.) to locate whatever newly added pipeline jobs, steps, or linter scripts correspond to that pipeline name.

- **Self-Loop Step 2 (FIRST ACTION: Update Python Runner Script):**
  1. Open `03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py`.
  2. Check whether the `JOBS` dictionary already covers the newly identified pipeline/job.
  3. **If NOT covered or new steps were added:**
     - Extract all shell commands from the workflow YAML.
     - Strip all Docker wrappers (translate to native host commands).
     - Update the `JOBS` dictionary in `06-cicd-local-runner.py` to register the new job.
     - Save the runner script and verify syntax.
     - Log: `"Updated 06-cicd-local-runner.py to include newly discovered pipeline job '<name>'."`

- **Self-Loop Step 3 (Execute Runner & Establish Baseline Failures):**
  1. Run `python 03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py`.
  2. Capture the full output and exit code.
  3. If exit code = 0: All jobs pass! Proceed to Phase 3 (Final Verification) and Phase 4 (Release).
  4. If exit code != 0: Zero in on the first specific failing job and its error output.

- **Self-Loop Step 4 (RCA & Zero In on the Specific Error):**
  1. For the zeroed-in failure, write a mandatory 4-part RCA file:
     - Path: `.lovable/memory/issues/xx-<slug>.md` (next sequential number)
     - Sections: **Why it happened / How it happened / Root Cause / Code Fix**
  2. Update `.lovable/01-index.md` and `.lovable/cicd-index.md`.
  3. Append any newly identified anti-pattern to `.lovable/strictly-avoid.md`.

- **Self-Loop Step 5 (Surgical Code Fix):**
  1. Open the specific offending source file and line identified in the RCA.
  2. Apply the minimal surgical fix cleanly.
  3. Run the guideline autofixer on modified files:
     ```text
     python 03-ai-scripts/05-guideline-autofixer.py <modified-files>
     ```

- **Self-Loop Step 6 (Re-Verify & Loop):**
  1. Re-run `python 03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py`.
  2. If the current error is fixed and other failures remain, self-loop to Step 4 to zero in on the next error.
  3. Continue looping until exit code = 0.

- **Self-Loop Step 7 (Proceed to Release):**
  1. Once exit code is 0, proceed directly to Phase 3 (Final Verification Gate) and Phase 4 (Release Publication).

---

## Phase 1: Local Runner Script Generation (Steps 1 to PHASE_1_STEPS)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This phase is dedicated ONLY to creating `03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py`.
> Do NOT fix source code in this phase. If Image Input Handling already updated the runner, verify and move on.

### Step 1: Check for Existing Script & Force Override

- Check if `03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py` already exists.
- **`force` Keyword Support:** If the user wrote `force`, `force rebuild`, or `force create` on top of the prompt or trigger: **ALWAYS recreate/regenerate the Python runner script from scratch**, regardless of whether the file already exists on disk.
- If it EXISTS and the user did **not** say `force`: skip to Phase 2.
- If MISSING or `force` was requested: execute Steps 2 through 4 for up to PHASE_1_STEPS iterations.

### Step 2: Deep CI/CD Configuration Scan

Read in this order:

1. **CI/CD configuration files:**
   - GitHub Actions: `.github/workflows/*.yml` (ALL files)
   - GitLab CI: `.gitlab-ci.yml`
   - Azure Pipelines: `azure-pipelines.yml`
   - Bitbucket: `bitbucket-pipelines.yml`
   - CircleCI: `.circleci/config.yml`
   - Custom: `Makefile`, `03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py`, `run.sh`, `run.ps1`
2. **Language config:** `.nvmrc`, `.python-version`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, `tsconfig.json`, lockfiles
3. **For every CI/CD job, record:**
   - `runs-on` image, all `run:` commands, `env:` variables, dependency install, lint, typecheck, build, and test commands
4. **Check local toolchain:** `node --version`, `go version`, `python3 --version`, etc.

### Step 3: Docker Translation Rule (CRITICAL)

The host machine IS the Docker container. Strip all Docker wrappers:

- `docker run --rm node:20 npm ci` → `npm ci`
- `docker run --rm python:3.12 pytest` → `python3 -m pytest`
- `docker run --rm golang:1.22 go test ./...` → `go test ./...`
- Replace Docker `env` injection with `os.environ` assignments.
- **Skip entirely:** `docker login`, image tagging, registry pushes.

### Step 4: Write `06-cicd-local-runner.py` (Worker Pool & Log Aggregation Architecture)

Generate `03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py` that:

1. **Round-Robin Worker Process / Thread Pool Architecture:** Runs tasks (tests, linters, builds) concurrently using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3)` (2–3 concurrent tasks).
2. **Enqueuing Announcement:** The script MUST announce upfront how many tasks it has enqueued across the worker pool (e.g. `[INFO] Enqueued 20 quality gates across 3 concurrent workers...`).
3. **Real-Time Progress & Timing:** Prints job completions in real time with individual runtimes (e.g. `PASS [Job Name] (X.XXs)`).
4. **Graceful Non-canceling Failure Handling:** If one job fails in a running batch, the runner DOES NOT abort or cancel other active workers. It lets running tasks finish gracefully, capturing all stdout and stderr.
5. **Consolidated Summary Report & Full Diagnostic Logs:** Prints a complete final summary with total executed, passed, failed, and timeouts. For every failed or timed-out job, it outputs the full command line, return code, stdout, and stderr so the agent has 100% complete RCA context.
6. **Clean Exit Code:** Exits with code 0 only when ALL jobs pass; exits non-zero if ANY job fails.

## Phase 2: Autonomous Fix Loop (Steps PHASE_1_STEPS+1 to N)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION MANDATE — DO NOT STOP.**
> Never stop to tell the user "here are the errors". Fix them. The local runner IS your CI/CD.

```text
STEP = 0
WHILE (STEP < PHASE_2_STEPS):
    STEP += 1

    1. Run: python 03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py
    2. Capture exit_code and full output.

    IF exit_code == 0:
        BREAK  ← Proceed to Phase 3: Final Verification.

    ELSE:
        3. Parse failure: identify exact failing job, error message, file, and line.
        4. Enqueue into .lovable/plans/pending/XX-cicd-<slug>.md (see Error Enqueuing section).
        5. Record in .lovable/cicd-issues/xx-<slug>.md and update index.
        6. Document 4-part RCA in .lovable/memory/issues/xx-<slug>.md.
        7. Apply the minimal surgical code fix.
        8. Run: python 03-ai-scripts/05-guideline-autofixer.py <modified-files>
        9. Loop immediately to step 1. DO NOT stop.

IF STEP >= PHASE_2_STEPS AND exit_code != 0:
    Report remaining failures clearly in chat and ask the user for guidance.
    DO NOT proceed to Phase 3 or Phase 4 until all failures are resolved.
```

### Self-Looping Agent Rules

- Each loop iteration = one AI tool call cycle. End your turn and immediately start the next.
- Only print progress when a job status changes. Do not reprint passing jobs every iteration.
- Spawn one sub-agent per independent failure (lint / test / typecheck failing separately). Give each sub-agent a single-file bounding box.

---

## Parallel Batch Execution Rules (Mandatory)

- `BATCH_SIZE = 3`: at most 3 jobs run simultaneously per batch.
- After each batch completes, wait for all futures before starting the next batch.
- Non-order-dependent jobs (lint, typecheck, unit tests) run within the same batch.
- Order-dependent jobs (install → build → test) must be placed in sequential batches.
- After every batch, inspect results immediately. Do not wait for the full run.

---

## Timeout Detection and Auto-Increase (Mandatory)

If any job shows ⏱ TIMEOUT:

1. Do NOT treat it as a code failure. Timeout means the job is slow, not broken.
2. Diagnose: large input set? network dependency (`npm ci`)? hung subprocess or lock file?
3. Increase `JOB_TIMEOUT_SEC` intelligently:
   - Elapsed close to the limit → increase by 50%.
   - Job hangs with no output for >30s → fix the subprocess call, not the timer.
   - Open `06-cicd-local-runner.py`, update `JOB_TIMEOUT_SEC`, save, re-run.
4. Re-run the runner. The timeout adjustment counts as one Phase 2 loop step.
5. Document the timeout change in `.lovable/cicd-issues/`.

---

## Error Enqueuing — Plan Task & CI/CD Issue (Mandatory on Every Failure)

On every ❌ FAIL or ⏱ TIMEOUT, BEFORE applying any code fix, do both:

### A. Enqueue into Plan Tasks (`.lovable/plans/pending/XX-cicd-<slug>.md`)

```markdown
# CI/CD Task: <short failure description>

## Source
- Runner job: <job-name>
- Error type: FAIL | TIMEOUT
- Detected at: <timestamp>

## Error Summary
<exact error message>

## Required Fix
<one-sentence description>

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `06-cicd-local-runner.py` reports ✅ PASS for job `<job-name>`
- [ ] No regression in any other job

## Status
- [ ] pending
```

Update `.lovable/plans/01-index.md` immediately.

### B. Record in CI/CD Issues (`.lovable/cicd-issues/xx-<slug>.md`)

```markdown
# CI/CD Issue: <short failure description>

- Job: <job-name>
- Type: FAIL | TIMEOUT
- Detected: <timestamp>
- Status: open | resolved

## Error
<exact error output>

## Root Cause
<one-sentence root cause>

## Fix Applied
<what was changed>

## Plan Task
Enqueued at `.lovable/plans/pending/XX-cicd-<slug>.md`
```

Update `.lovable/cicd-index.md` in the same operation. Never delete existing entries.

---

## Phase 3: Final Verification (Gate Before Release)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Phase 3 is a hard gate. The release MUST NOT start until every item below is green.
> If any item fails, loop back to Phase 2 immediately.

- [ ] **Full Unit Test & CI/CD Verification (MANDATORY Before Release):** Run `python 03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py --run-tests` one final time. All unit test suites, AST checks, and quality gates MUST pass 100% green (`exit 0`). The release MUST NOT start if any test fails.
- [ ] **Test Inventory Validation:** Check `.lovable/temp/recent-file-changes.json` against `.lovable/test-inventory.json` and verify all tests associated with modified files pass.
- [ ] **No open plan tasks from this run:** All `.lovable/plans/pending/XX-cicd-*.md` files created in this run are marked `resolved` or closed.
- [ ] **All RCA files written:** Every failure encountered has a `.lovable/memory/issues/xx-<slug>.md` with all 4 sections.
- [ ] **Coding standards pass:** Run `python 03-ai-scripts/05-guideline-autofixer.py` on all modified files. Zero violations remain.
- [ ] **Git working tree is clean:** Run `git status`. No untracked or unstaged files. Commit any remaining changes with `fix(ci): final pre-release fixes`.

---

## Phase 4: Release

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only enter Phase 4 after Phase 3 passes 100%. No exceptions.

### Step R-1: Pre-Flight Checks

1. Run `git status`. If uncommitted changes remain: commit them now with `fix(ci): pre-release cleanup`.
2. Run `git pull` to merge any upstream changes.
3. Read the current version from `version.json` (canonical source). Print it.
4. Idempotency guard: if the canonical version already equals the computed new version, STOP. Someone half-ran a release. Detect what is done, resume from the first incomplete step. Do NOT double-bump.
5. Placeholder guard: if the previous version's changelog entry is empty or contains `TBD`/`WIP`, refuse to release until it is filled (or the user overrides).

### Step R-2: Bump the Version

### Step R-2: Bump the Version & Assemble Release Body

**Primary path — use the exact script at this path:**

```text
python .lovable/release/bump_versions.py --type minor --create-release
```

The `--create-release` flag handles:

1. Creating the `release/vX.Y.Z` git branch
2. Updating all version pin sites
3. Assembling the release notes file with **Quick Install One-Liners** and changelog
4. Committing, tagging `vX.Y.Z`, and pushing
5. Creating the GitHub/GitLab release via `gh release create` (with `--notes-file`) or `glab release create`

### MANDATORY: Release Page Install One-Liners (FATAL IF MISSED ON GITHUB/GITLAB)

> [!CAUTION]
> **NEVER run `gh release create <tag> --generate-notes` ALONE.**
> Running `--generate-notes` without a structured `--notes-file` is a FATAL DEFECT: GitHub will only display commit hashes (as seen in broken release pages) and completely omits the installation one-liners!
>
> Every published GitHub / GitLab release page MUST have the **Quick Install One-Liners** prominently placed right at the top of the release body!

Before calling `gh release create` or `glab release create`, the release automation MUST assemble a release notes file (e.g. `.lovable/release/release-notes-vX.Y.Z.md` or `/tmp/release-body.md`) containing:

#### 1. Quick Install One-Liners by Project Type

**For Binary / Download Asset Repositories (e.g., Go/Rust/C CLI tools like `gitmap`):**

```markdown
## Quick Install vX.Y.Z

### Windows (PowerShell 5.1+)
```powershell
irm https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Linux / macOS (Bash)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/install.sh | bash
```
```

**For Script / Meta-Repositories (e.g., `prompt-architect`):**

```markdown
## Quick Install vX.Y.Z

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/vX.Y.Z/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1; .\install.ps1 -TargetDir ".lovable/prompts" -Version "vX.Y.Z"
```

### Unix / Bash

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/vX.Y.Z/install.sh | bash -s -- ".lovable/prompts" "vX.Y.Z"
```
```

#### 2. Changelog Section for vX.Y.Z

Directly below the Quick Install block, include the extracted `[vX.Y.Z]` section from `changelog.md`.

#### 3. Platform Release Command

Pass the generated notes file via `--notes-file`:

```bash
gh release create "vX.Y.Z" --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes-file ".lovable/release/release-notes-vX.Y.Z.md" --generate-notes
```

*(Note: `--generate-notes` may be appended so GitHub adds commit logs below the install one-liners and changelog, but `--notes-file` is MANDATORY).*

---

**Fallback chain (if `.lovable/release/bump_versions.py` is missing):**

1. **Fallback 1:** Read `.lovable/release/release-method.md` to identify all version pin sites. Regenerate `bump_versions.py` from that documentation. Ensure it generates the release notes file with the Quick Install one-liners before running `gh release create`.
2. **Fallback 2:** If `release-method.md` is also missing, walk the repository with Python `os.walk` (ignoring `.git`, `node_modules`, `.venv`) to discover all version pin sites. Write `release-method.md` documenting them. Generate `bump_versions.py` with the correct `FILES_TO_BUMP`, release notes generator, `git checkout -b`, `git commit`, `git tag`, `git push`, and `gh release create ... --notes-file` logic. Run it.
3. **Fallback 3:** If discovery fails, stop and ask the user to specify the version pin sites explicitly.

> [!CAUTION]
> **NEVER use `rg`, `grep`, or `find` to globally search for version strings.** Follow the fallback chain above. Global searches on large repos are slow and error-prone.

### Step R-3: Pin the New Version in `readme.md`

Rewrite every occurrence of the previous version (`vX.Y.Z` and bare `X.Y.Z`) in badges, install snippets, and inline references. After this step, `grep "<previous-version>" readme.md` MUST return nothing.

### Step R-4: Write the Changelog Entry

Add the following block at the top of `changelog.md`, directly under `# Changelog`:

```markdown
## [vX.Y.Z] YYYY-MM-DD <short headline>

### Install <Project Name> vX.Y.Z

Unix/Bash:
`curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/vX.Y.Z/install.sh | bash -s -- ".lovable/prompts" "vX.Y.Z"`

PowerShell:
`Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/vX.Y.Z/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1; .\install.ps1 -TargetDir ".lovable/prompts" -Version "vX.Y.Z"`

### Added / Changed / Fixed / Removed

- <one bullet per real change, naming the exact file or behavior>

### Issues (only if any step failed)

- [xx-<slug>](.lovable/release/issues/XX-vX.Y.Z-<slug>.md) short description
```

Dynamically discover `<owner>/<repo>` by running `git config --get remote.origin.url`. Do NOT hardcode URLs.

### Step R-5: Final Verification After Bump

1. Run the version-sync check if one exists (`scripts/check-version-sync.*`, `scripts/verify-versions.*`). It MUST exit 0.
2. Verify ALL pin sites reference the new version. No previous-version strings outside the historic allow-list (`changelog.md`, `release_notes.md`, `.lovable/release/`, dated archives).
3. All markdown filenames in the repository MUST be strictly lowercase. Rename any uppercase files with `git mv` in the same turn.

### Step R-6: Issue Logging (If Anything Goes Wrong)

If any release step fails, write an issue file at:

```text
.lovable/release/issues/XX-vX.Y.Z-<slug>.md
```

Include: previous version, new version, step number and name, command run, full error output, files involved, resolution or `unresolved`. Link it from the `### Issues` bullet in the changelog entry.

## STRICT AVOIDANCE: Never Disable CLI Linting, Static Analysis, or CI/CD Checks (No Shortcut Cheating)

> [!CAUTION]
> **TOTAL BAN ON DISABLING, SKIPPING, OR BYPASSING CLI LINTERS AND CI/CD GATES:**
>
> - **NEVER** disable, comment out, delete, or skip any CLI linting command (`golangci-lint`, `eslint`, `markdownlint`, `tsc`, `pytest`, `phpstan`, `mypy`, `check-*.py`), build step, or test suite.
> - **NEVER** add `|| true`, `continue-on-error: true`, `# nolint`, `// eslint-disable`, or ignore flags to "quickly win the race" or fake a pipeline pass.
> - **Your job is to legitimately fix the underlying source code.** If resolving complex lint errors or test failures requires multiple sub-steps, sub-agents, or nested self-looping turns, you MUST execute all necessary turns until the code is 100% clean and compliant.
> - Disabling or bypassing any CI/CD or CLI lint check is an automatic and immediate rejection.

---

## Mandatory Pre-Release Full Unit Tests & CI/CD Verification (Strict Policy)

> [!CAUTION]
> **ALL CI/CD FIXES & RELEASES MUST RUN TESTS PROPERLY:** This workflow repairs CI/CD pipelines and cuts a release. You MUST NOT skip or disable tests with `--no-tests`. All unit test suites, integration tests, AST checks, and quality gates MUST be executed and verified green (`python 03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py --run-tests`).
> **ATOMIC CHANGE TRACKING:** Record all modified files under lock via `python 03-ai-scripts/33-test-inventory-generator.py --record <files...>`.

---

## Non-Negotiable Coding Standards

- [ ] **No Disabling CLI Linting (Zero Bypassing):** All CLI linters and CI/CD quality gates executed fully without `|| true`, `continue-on-error`, or suppression comments. Code was legitimately fixed.
- [ ] **Zero Actions Storage (Total Ban on CI Artifacts):** Confirmed that NO `actions/upload-artifact` steps exist in CI workflows; all diagnostic outputs stream to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` or console logs.
- [ ] **Legitimate Multi-Step Self-Looping:** If complex errors occurred, I performed dedicated, single-step self-loop iterations to resolve each underlying failure instead of taking shortcuts.
- [ ] **Return New Line (R13-R16):** Blank line before `return`/`throw` (unless sole statement). Blank line after `}`. Never two blank lines in a row.
- [ ] **No Explicit True Checks:** Never `== true`. Write `if isReady`.
- [ ] **No Mixed Polarity:** Never `if isA && !isB`. Extract to a named boolean.
- [ ] **Boolean Prefixes & IsDefined:** All booleans start with `is` or `has` only (all other prefixes banned). MANDATORY: Use `isDefined` (or `res.IsDefined()`) instead of inverted empty checks (`!isEmpty` / `!res.IsEmpty()`). Map lookups use `val, isFound := userMap[id]` or `val, isUserExist := userMap[id]`.
- [ ] **Error Handling:** No swallowed errors. Wrap with `apperror.Wrap(err, "opName", ctx)`.
- [ ] **Strict Lowercase Files:** All generated/modified files use strictly lowercase naming.
- [ ] **Go Generate Sync:** If Go constants, enums, or stringers were modified, run `go generate ./...` and commit generated files.
