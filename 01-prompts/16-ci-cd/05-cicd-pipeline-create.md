## 2. Strict In-Repository Execution & Cross-Platform Python-First Mandate

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **STRICT IN-REPOSITORY EXECUTION & `.lovable/` STORAGE CONTRACT:**
>
> 1. **In-Codebase Execution Only:** Whenever a Python script (runner, autofixer, linter, test aggregator) is executed or created, it MUST be executed **strictly within the repository root** (current working directory), NEVER outside the codebase or against external arbitrary directories.
> 2. **Strict Folder Bounding (`.lovable/`):** All AI scripts, local runners, autofixers, helper utilities, memory issue logs, and planning files MUST be created inside the `.lovable/` folder:
>    - Python AI Scripts: `03-ai-scripts/` (e.g. `01-file-manipulator.py`, `05-guideline-autofixer.py`, `06-cicd-local-runner.py`).
>    - RCA & Issue Logs: `.lovable/memory/issues/` and `.lovable/cicd-issues/`.
>    - Execution Plans & Subtasks: `.lovable/plans/pending/`, `.lovable/plans/subtasks/`.
>    - Coding Guidelines Mirror: `.lovable/coding-guidelines.md`.
> 3. **Python-First Cross-Platform Automation:** All CI/CD build scripts, test runners, validation checks, and linters MUST be written in **Python 3** (`subprocess`, `sys`, `os`, `pathlib`, `concurrent.futures`, `json`, `shutil`) ensuring identical, deterministic execution across **Windows, Linux, and macOS**. Shell scripts (`.sh`, `.ps1`) must ONLY act as lightweight one-line entrypoints invoking Python.
> 4. **Strict Relative Git Paths (TOTAL BAN on Absolute Paths / `file:///` URIs):** All file paths, markdown links, citations, and subtask paths inside plans, RCA logs (`.lovable/memory/issues/`), scripts, and code comments MUST be strictly relative paths from the git root (e.g., `02-spec/03-error-manage/01-index.md`, `.lovable/plans/01-index.md`, `cmd/main.go`). NEVER write absolute OS paths (`/absolute/path/to/...`, `/absolute/path/to/...`, `/home/...`) or absolute file URIs (`file:///...`).
>    - ❌ **BAD:** `[SSH Commands](file:///absolute/path/to/...)`
>    - ✅ **GOOD:** `[SSH Commands]`02-spec/13-generic-cli/01-index.md)`
> 5. **No External or Random File Creation:** NEVER write scripts, temporary test scripts, or scratch files to root, `/tmp`, global system paths, or outside the repository boundary.
> 6. **Temp & Failure Folder Isolation:** All temporary directories, runner caches, and test artifacts MUST be strictly placed in `.lovable/temp/`. Creating `.tmp/` at the repository root or outside `.lovable/` is strictly forbidden.
>    - Dedicated Failure Directory: `.lovable/temp/failures/` is the dedicated folder where failed tests and failed quality gates write error logs (`<test-or-job-name>.log`).
>    - Passing Tests Completely Silent: Passing tests must produce ZERO filesystem artifacts (zero files written) and remain completely silent in output logs.
> 7. **Runner In-Flight ETA Wait Protocol:** When running background commands, the runner dynamically writes live status and remaining ETA to `.lovable/temp/runner-eta.json` (emitting in-flight heartbeats strictly every 25 seconds or more). If an agent inspects an active background job and it is still running, the agent MUST sleep/wait for **1 minute (60 seconds) each time**, or dynamically sleep for the remaining ETA duration read from `.lovable/temp/runner-eta.json` (or based on previous total approximate delay) instead of busy-polling or querying in loops.
> 8. **Centralized Test Inventory & Incremental Caching:** All unit tests are cataloged in `.lovable/test-inventory.json` with strictly repository-relative paths (`target_file`, `test_file`). First run executes all tests to establish baseline timings; subsequent runs execute incrementally only if target code files or test files change. Slow test threshold defaults to `4.0s` (configurable via `GITMAP_SLOW_TEST_THRESHOLD`).
> 9. **Dual-Queue Worker Pools:** Slow tests run in a dedicated 4-worker pool running at most 2 tests at a time per batch. Fast tests run in a 4-worker pool running at most 4 tests at a time, pulling in chunks of 100 tests from the test inventory queue until all are complete.
> 10. **Dynamic ETA Sleep Protocol:** The AI agent reads `.lovable/temp/runner-eta.json`, sleeps for the estimated wait time rather than looping, and if still active upon waking, re-checks remaining ETA and sleeps again to avoid burning tokens.

```

## 3. Phase 1: Local Automation & Python Runner Setup (Steps 1 to PHASE_1_STEPS)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Build the local cross-platform foundation first.** Remote CI/CD workflows merely mirror the local Python runner.

### Step 1: Detect Tech Stack & Toolchains

1. Inspect project files (`package.json`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `composer.json`, `version.json`).
2. Identify target compilers, linters, and test engines.
3. Record exact commands needed for:
   - Dependency installation (`npm ci`, `go mod download`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `composer install`).
   - Linting & static analysis (`golangci-lint`, `eslint`, `markdownlint`, `tsc --noEmit`, `phpcs`, `mypy`).
   - Build & compilation (`npm run build`, `go build`, `python -m build`, `cargo build`).
   - Automated testing (`npm test`, `go test -race ./...`, `pytest`, `cargo test`).

### Step 2: Implement Cross-Platform Python Linters

If custom checks or guideline validations are required:

1. Write or update Python scripts in `linter-scripts/` (e.g., `validate-guidelines.py`, `check-markdown-header-spacing.py`).
2. Ensure linters output standard error formats: `file:line:col: [RULE-CODE] message`.
3. Support `--fix` flag wherever deterministic AST/regex automated repair is possible.

### Step 3: Check for Existing Script & Force Override

- Check if `03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py` already exists.
- **`force` Keyword Support:** If the user wrote `force`, `force rebuild`, or `force create` on top of the prompt or trigger: **ALWAYS recreate/regenerate the Python runner script from scratch**, regardless of whether the file already exists on disk.
- If it EXISTS and the user did **not** specify `force`: proceed to verification.
- If it is MISSING or `force` was requested: generate the script following the worker pool architecture below.

### Step 4: Write `06-cicd-local-runner.py` (Worker Pool & Log Aggregation Architecture)

Generate `03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py` following these architectural requirements:

1. **Round-Robin Worker Process / Thread Pool Architecture:** Runs tasks (tests, linters, builds) concurrently using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3)` (2–3 concurrent tasks).
2. **Enqueuing Announcement:** The script MUST announce upfront how many tasks it has enqueued across the worker pool (e.g. `[INFO] Enqueued 20 quality gates across 3 concurrent workers...`).
3. **Real-Time Progress & Timing:** Prints job completions in real time with individual runtimes (e.g. `PASS [Job Name] (X.XXs)`).
4. **Graceful Non-canceling Failure Handling:** If one job fails in a running batch, the runner DOES NOT abort or cancel other active workers. It lets running tasks finish gracefully, capturing all stdout and stderr.
5. **Consolidated Summary Report & Full Diagnostic Logs:** Prints a complete final summary with total executed, passed, failed, and timeouts. For every failed or timed-out job, it outputs the full command line, return code, stdout, and stderr so the agent has 100% complete RCA context.
6. **Clean Exit Code:** Exits with code 0 only when ALL jobs pass; exits non-zero if ANY job fails.

**Standard generated runner template:**

```python

## 4. Phase 2: Workflow Generation & Green Gate Verification (Steps PHASE_1_STEPS+1 to N)

### Step 1: Generate GitHub Actions Workflows (`.github/workflows/`)

1. Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` covering:
   - Matrix builds across OS platforms (`ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, `macos-latest`) where applicable.
   - Cache steps (`actions/cache`, `actions/setup-node`, `actions/setup-python`, `actions/setup-go`).
   - Linting, typechecking, building, and testing jobs.
   - Invocation of native Python runner and scripts.
2. Create `.github/workflows/release.yml` covering:
   - Tagged release triggers (`v*`).
   - Multi-arch cross-compilation.
   - Checksum generation (`sha256sum`).
   - Release creation with `--notes-file` and Quick Install one-liners.

### Step 2: Autonomous Local Verification Loop

Execute the local runner and resolve every failure singly using self-looping turns:

```text
LOOP:
    1. Execute: python 03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py
    2. IF exit code == 0:
           SUCCESS -> Proceed to Stage & Commit.
    3. IF exit code != 0:
           Zero in on the first failing job.
           Document 4-part RCA in .lovable/memory/issues/xx-<slug>.md.
           Apply surgical fix to source code or python script.
           Re-verify with 06-cicd-local-runner.py.
           Repeat loop.
```

---

## STRICT AVOIDANCE: Never Disable CLI Linting or CI/CD Checks

> [!CAUTION]
> **TOTAL BAN ON DISABLING, SKIPPING, OR BYPASSING CLI LINTERS AND CI/CD GATES:**
>
> - **NEVER** disable, comment out, delete, or skip any CLI linting command (`golangci-lint`, `eslint`, `markdownlint`, `tsc`, `pytest`, `phpstan`, `mypy`, `check-*.py`), build step, or test suite.
> - **NEVER** add `|| true`, `continue-on-error: true`, `# nolint`, `// eslint-disable`, or ignore flags to "quickly win the race" or fake a pipeline pass.
> - **Your job is to legitimately fix the underlying source code and python scripts.** If resolving complex lint errors or test failures requires multiple sub-steps or nested self-looping turns, you MUST execute all necessary turns until the code is 100% clean and compliant.
> - Disabling or bypassing any CI/CD or CLI lint check is an automatic and immediate rejection.

---

## Strictly Avoid: No Automatic Releases & Run All Tests (Strict Policy)

> [!CAUTION]
> **NO AUTOMATIC RELEASES:** This prompt creates and verifies CI/CD infrastructure. You MUST NOT bump versions, update changelogs, or cut a release unless the user explicitly commands it in chat (e.g., "cut a release" or "bump the version"). All commits use `feat(ci): <description>` or `fix(ci): <description>`.
> **RUN ALL TESTS & QUALITY GATES (FULL PIPELINE FIDELITY):** All newly created CI/CD pipelines, local runners, and jobs MUST execute and verify all unit test suites, integration tests, and quality gates properly (`python 03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py`). NEVER skip or disable tests with `--no-tests` during pipeline creation and verification.
> **ATOMIC CHANGE TRACKING:** Record all modified files under lock via `python 03-ai-scripts/33-test-inventory-generator.py --record <files...>`.

---

## Anti-Hallucination, Micro-Tasking, & Self-Looping

> [!CAUTION]
> **CRITICAL RULE: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO READ, PLAN, AND EXECUTE EVERYTHING AT ONCE.**
> If you try to consume a massive codebase and write all CI/CD pipelines in a single turn, you WILL hallucinate, drop requirements, and fail.

To survive massive checklists and complex codebases, you MUST operate using these three principles:

1. **Phase 1: Read & Understand (Isolated Loop):** Your very first action must be purely exploratory. Do NOT write code. Break down the task, read the specific files, trace the dependencies, and understand the architectural boundary. Once you understand the scope, end your turn and self-loop to begin execution.
2. **Phase 2: Bounded Micro-Tasking (Sequential Self-Looping):** Never attempt to execute the entire checklist in one response. Treat each checklist section or file as a strict, isolated boundary. Execute *only* the first small portion, verify it, end your turn, and self-loop to process the next portion.
3. **Phase 3: Multi-Agent Parallelization:** If tasks are independent, you MUST spawn dedicated sub-agents to handle them concurrently (up to 2-3 threads max). Give each sub-agent an extremely small, strictly defined bounding box (e.g., "Only write Python lint script for Go"). Never give a sub-agent a generic or multi-directory task.
