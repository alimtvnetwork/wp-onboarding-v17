# Canonical Folder Structure & Sizing Rules — Architecture Spec (must follow)

> **Prompt Version:** 2.1.0
> **Synchronization:** Single Source of Truth Mirror for `.lovable/folder-structure.md`
> **Target:** `01-prompts/00-folder-structure/01-canonical-folder-structure.md`

Every AI prompt and agent MUST strictly adhere to the central repository layout defined below and in `.lovable/folder-structure.md`. No invented folders, no alternate paths.

All dates are UTC. All filenames are lowercase kebab-case with a two-digit zero-padded `XX-` prefix where sequencing applies. `XX-` is monotonic within its folder scope.

## Numbering Rules (`XX-` Monotonic Sequencing)

1. Two-digit zero-padded, monotonic per folder scope (`01-`, `02-`, ...).
2. Next `XX-` = max existing `XX-` in that folder scope + 1. Never reuse or decrement.
3. Plans: `XX-` is monotonic across `pending/`, `subtasks/`, and `completed/` combined.

## Hard Rules & Prohibitions

- **Single Authority:** [`.lovable/folder-structure.md`](.lovable/folder-structure.md) is the absolute single source of truth.
- **Strict Plurality:** Always `.lovable/memory/` (singular), `.lovable/plans/` (plural), `01-prompts/` (plural), `.lovable/suggestions/` (plural).
- **No Orphaned Folders:** Never invent unapproved folders (e.g., `memories/`, `tasks/`, `todos/`).
- **Relative Paths Only:** All file paths must be relative from the git root. Absolute paths (`C:\...`, `file:///...`) are banned.
