# Canonical Folder Structure Specification

> **Target:** `.lovable/folder-structure.md`
> **Authority:** Single Source of Truth for `.lovable/` Ecosystem & Repository Organization
> **Version:** 4.0.0

This document defines the authoritative canonical structure of the repository, including the `.lovable/` AI metadata layer and the `02-spec/` specification tree. All AI agents MUST strictly adhere to this architecture when reading, indexing, or writing files.

---

## 1. The `XX-<slug>` Deterministic Prefixing System

To maintain deterministic sorting and avoid ambiguity across operating systems, every file and directory within structured modules (`.lovable/plans/`, `01-prompts/`, `03-ai-scripts/`, `02-spec/`) MUST follow the two-digit zero-padded numeric prefix:

- **Format:** `XX-<slug-name>.ext` or `XX-<slug-name>/`
- **Prefix Range:** Starts at `01-` (or `00-` for root configuration indexes) and increments sequentially (`01-`, `02-`, ...).
- **Lowercase Mandate:** Strictly lowercase ASCII (`[0-9a-z_-]`). No uppercase letters, spaces, or camelCase.
- **Rule:** When creating a new file or subtask, identify the highest existing `XX-` prefix in that directory and increment by 1.

## 3. Canonical `02-spec/` Specification Hierarchy

The `02-spec/` directory is organized into numbered tiers:

- **Tiers 01–20 (Core Fundamentals):** Reusable standards, architecture blueprints, database conventions, and design systems.
- **Tiers 21+ (App-Specific Modules):** Application business logic, features, and domain-specific schemas.

| Tier | Module Directory | Focus Area |
|:---:|---|---|
| **01** | `02-spec/01-spec-authoring-guide/` | Meta-guide on writing and maintaining specifications |
| **02** | `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/` | Cross-language standards (TypeScript, Go, PHP, Rust, C#) |
| **03** | `02-spec/03-error-manage/` | Error envelopes, application errors, and error codes |
| **04** | `02-spec/04-database-conventions/` | Database schema conventions, ORM mappings, views |
| **05** | `02-spec/05-split-db-architecture/` | Split database pattern (operational vs. config DBs) |
| **06** | `02-spec/06-seedable-config-architecture/` | Seedable configuration with versioned changelogs |
| **07** | `02-spec/07-design-system/` | Design tokens, component hierarchies, dark mode |
| **08** | `02-spec/08-docs-viewer-ui/` | Documentation viewer UI and slide presentation system |
| **09** | `02-spec/09-code-block-system/` | Syntax highlighting pipeline and code block copy/run |
| **10** | `02-spec/10-research/` | Technology evaluations and benchmark studies |
| **11** | `02-spec/11-powershell-integration/` | Cross-platform PowerShell automation standards |
| **12** | `02-spec/12-cicd-pipeline-workflows/` | CI/CD workflows, GitHub Actions, and quality gates |
| **13** | `02-spec/13-generic-cli/` | Generic CLI UX, exit codes, and flag semantics |
| **14** | `02-spec/14-update/` | CLI self-update architecture and release delivery |
| **15** | `02-spec/15-distribution-and-runner/` | Cross-platform installers, runners, and forwarding |
| **16** | `02-spec/16-generic-release/` | Universal release pipeline blueprint and asset matrices |
| **17** | `02-spec/17-consolidated-guidelines/` | Single-file AI summaries of all major spec modules |
| **18** | `02-spec/18-wp-plugin-how-to/` | WordPress plugin architecture and REST APIs |
| **19** | `02-spec/19-main-worker-service/` | Split-tier worker service and proxy nodes |
| **21+**| `02-spec/21-app/` ... `02-spec/24-app-ui-design-system/` | App-specific workflows, UI components, and domain DBs |

## 4. Governance & Synchronization Invariants

1. **Strict Relative Paths:** All internal markdown links, citations, and subtask paths MUST use relative paths starting from the repository root (e.g. `.lovable/plans/pending/01-task.md`, `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/01-index.md`). Absolute filesystem paths (`C:\...`, `/home/...`, `file:///...`) are strictly prohibited.
2. **Strict Lowercase:** All generated files and directories MUST be lowercase.
3. **Plurality Invariants:** Always `.lovable/memory/` (singular), `.lovable/plans/` (plural), `01-prompts/` (plural), `.lovable/suggestions/` (plural).
4. **Mirror Parity:** Every script in `03-ai-scripts/` MUST have an exact mirror in `.agents/scripts/`.
5. **Quality Gates:** Before concluding any engineering task, execute `python 03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py` to confirm all 18 quality checks pass.
