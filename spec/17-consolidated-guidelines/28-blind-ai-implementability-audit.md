# Blind-AI Implementability Audit — Critical Gap Analysis

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Updated:** 2026-04-22
**Scope:** `02-spec/17-consolidated-guidelines/` + `06-error-management.md` only
**Question:** _If a "blind AI" — one with zero access to source specs, source code, or prior conversations — receives only the consolidated folder, how far can it go before failing?_

---

## TL;DR — The Honest Answer

| Capability | Score | Verdict |
|------------|-------|---------|
| **Understand the rules conceptually** | 95/100 | Excellent — the consolidated docs explain the *what* and *why* clearly |
| **Reproduce the rules from scratch in a new project** | 78/100 | Good but lossy — most patterns have code examples; some require interpretation |
| **Modify or extend the existing live system** | 52/100 | **Risky** — the consolidated docs lack live file paths, line numbers, exact identifiers, and runtime contracts |
| **Pass the project's own validators** | 41/100 | **Likely to fail** — only 3 of 16 linter scripts are mentioned by name; waiver syntax, allowlist formats, and exit-code contracts are absent |

**Bottom line:** A blind AI handed only `17-consolidated-guidelines/` + `06-error-management.md` can **build a fresh, spec-compliant project** with reasonable fidelity, but **cannot safely modify this repo** without reading source folders. The biggest single failure mode is **silent linter divergence** — the AI will write code that *looks* right but trips validators it has never heard of.

---

## How This Audit Was Performed

1. Inventoried all 25 files in `17-consolidated-guidelines/` (12,621 lines, 218 fenced code blocks).
2. Extracted every named identifier: scripts, functions, env vars, file paths, error codes, table names, CLI flags.
3. Diffed against the actual repo: `linter-scripts/` (16 files), `scripts/` (9 files), source folders (22).
4. Stress-tested 8 common AI tasks ("add a new error code", "add a new column", "ship a release") against the consolidated text alone.

## Critical Issues — Where a Blind AI Will Fail

### 🔴 CRITICAL-1 — Linter Script Blindness (Severity: Highest)

**The gap:** The consolidated docs reference exactly **3 linter scripts by name**:

- `linter-scripts/validate-guidelines.py`
- `linter-scripts/check-spec-cross-links.py`
- `linter-scripts/check-code-collisions.py` _(does not even exist — the real name is `check-spec-cross-links.py` or `check-spec-folder-refs.py`)_

The repo actually ships **16 linter assets**:

| Script | Purpose | Mentioned in consolidated? |
|--------|---------|----------------------------|
| `validate-guidelines.py` | Code-Red metrics | ✅ |
| `validate-guidelines.go` | Go port of validator | ❌ |
| `check-spec-cross-links.py` | Markdown link integrity | ✅ |
| `check-spec-folder-refs.py` | Folder-reference allowlist enforcement | ❌ |
| `check-axios-version.sh` | Axios pinning enforcement | ❌ |
| `check-forbidden-strings.py` | Forbidden-token scanner | ❌ |
| `check-forbidden-spec-paths.sh` | Forbidden spec-path guard | ❌ |
| `forbidden-strings.toml` | Forbidden-token config | ❌ |
| `spec-cross-links.allowlist` | Allowlist syntax | ❌ |
| `spec-folder-refs.allowlist` | `[external]` / `[doc-only]` syntax | ❌ |
| `suggest-spec-cross-link-fixes.py` | Auto-fix helper | ❌ |
| `generate-dashboard-data.cjs` | Dashboard JSON producer | ❌ |
| `installer-templates/` | Versioned installer templates | ❌ |
| `run.ps1` / `run.sh` | Linter orchestrators | ❌ |

**Failure mode:** A blind AI will commit code that looks pristine but fails CI on the first push because:

1. It used a forbidden token from `forbidden-strings.toml` it never saw.
2. It bumped Axios to a blocked version (1.14.1 / 0.30.4) it doesn't know about.
3. It added a sibling-repo reference without registering it in `spec-folder-refs.allowlist [external]`.
4. It wrote markdown links that broke `check-spec-cross-links.py` allowlist conventions.

**Fix:** Add a "Validator Inventory" section to `05-coding-guidelines.md` listing every script, its exit-code contract, the file it consumes, and an example invocation.

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL-2 — Waiver / Allowlist Syntax Is Undocumented

**The gap:** Memory references `DB-FREETEXT-001` and `MISSING-DESC-001` waiver syntax (see `mem://sessions/2026-04-sql-linter-rules`), and the `spec-folder-refs.allowlist` requires `[external]` / `[doc-only]` sections. **Zero of these syntaxes appear in any consolidated file.**

**Failure mode:** When CI fails with `Stale references found`, the blind AI will guess at the file format — likely producing JSON, YAML, or commented-out lines instead of the actual TOML-like section format. Recent conversation history shows this exact failure already happened.

**Fix:** Add a "Waiver & Allowlist Reference" appendix to `21-database-conventions.md` and `04-spec-authoring.md` with literal file excerpts.

---

### 🔴 CRITICAL-3 — Sync-Script Contract Is Implicit

**The gap:** Consolidated docs mention `scripts/sync-version.mjs` and `scripts/sync-spec-tree.mjs` exist, but never specify:

- The exact invocation order (bump `package.json` → `sync-version` → `sync-spec-tree`).
- Which fields in `version.json` are computed vs hand-edited.
- That `version.json` drift is a hard CI failure (`Error: Drift detected in version.json`).
- That the sync writes to `src/data/specTree.json` and any manual edit there will be clobbered.

**Failure mode:** Recent CI logs show this exact failure: a blind AI bumped versions without running `sync-version.mjs`, producing a 50-line drift diff and a red pipeline.

**Fix:** Add a "Version & Sync Workflow" section to `04-spec-authoring.md` with the literal command sequence and the consequences of skipping a step.

---

### 🟠 HIGH-1 — Error Code Registry Has No Live Inventory

**The gap:** `06-error-management.md` §26 documents that an error code registry exists and that codes are PascalCase like `RagChunkNotFound`. It **does not** include:

- The current list of codes already used (so the AI invents duplicates).
- The numeric range allocations per subsystem (1xxx, 2xxx, ...).
- The generator command that produces `apperror_codes_generated.go`, `ErrorCode.php`, `errorCodes.generated.ts`.
- The test that fails when codes drift between languages.

**Failure mode:** Blind AI invents `ErrorCode 1001` for a new feature, colliding with an existing code, and ships a build that compiles but breaks downstream language ports.

**Fix:** Embed the master registry table (or a generated snapshot) directly in `06-error-management.md`, plus the code-generation command line.

---

### 🟠 HIGH-2 — Database Migration Mechanics Are Absent

**The gap:** `21-database-conventions.md` documents naming, schema design, free-text rules, and the 3-tier split-DB pattern in 1,065 lines. It does **not** specify:

- Which migration tool is used (`golang-migrate`, GORM AutoMigrate, custom SQL files, Atlas?).
- Where migration files live on disk.
- The naming convention for migration files.
- How to write a reversible migration.
- How to add a column to an existing table without breaking RLS / Casbin policies.
- Whether migrations are checked into the same repo or pulled from elsewhere.

**Failure mode:** Blind AI is asked to "add `LastLoginAt` to `User`" and produces a hand-written `ALTER TABLE` with no migration framework wiring, breaking the deploy pipeline.

**Fix:** Add a "Migrations" section to `21-database-conventions.md` with the tool, path, file-naming, and a worked example.

---

### 🟠 HIGH-3 — Self-Update Probe Has Documentation but No Runtime Contract

**The gap:** `20-self-update-app-update.md` describes the 20-repo version probe, the Identity Ladder, and middle-out dispatch. It does **not** specify:

- The exact regex string used to parse install URLs (the source has it; the consolidated paraphrases).
- The exact env var names a host can set to override (`INSTALL_PROBE_OWNER`, `INSTALL_PROBE_BASE`, `INSTALL_PROBE_VERSION`, `INSTALL_PROBE_HANDOFF_DEPTH`).
- The fail-open default version number (`14`).
- The HTTP timeout per probe (`2s`).

**Failure mode:** Blind AI re-implements the probe with different env var names, breaking host integrations that already export the originals.

**Fix:** Promote the verbatim regex, env var names, and timeout constants from the source spec into the consolidated file. Treat them as a runtime contract.

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM-1 — App-Specific Folders Are Placeholder-Only

`16-app.md`, `17-app-issues.md`, `24-lovable-folder-03-structure.md` are short placeholders that defer to source folders containing only `01-index.md`. A blind AI cannot distinguish between "this is intentionally minimal" and "this is missing content." `27-folder-mapping.md` flags these as 🟡 — that mitigation is sufficient for now, but the AI must read the mapping file first.

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM-2 — Cross-Language Enum Generators Are Not Specified

`07-enum-standards.md` documents the parsing methods (Go `ParseEnum`, TS `parse()`, PHP `from()`, Rust `FromStr`) but does not document **how** these stay synchronized across languages. If the project uses a code generator (it does), the consolidated docs do not name the source-of-truth file or the generator command.

**Failure mode:** Blind AI adds an enum value to one language and ships a partial implementation.

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM-3 — Memory File Conventions Are Not Surfaced

The user's `mem://` files contain critical operational rules (axios pinning, gitmap-sync exclusions, code-red metrics, free-text linter rules). A blind AI receiving only the consolidated folder will violate at least three of these on its first PR. `24-lovable-folder-03-structure.md` mentions the `.lovable/` folder exists but does not enumerate the active core memory rules.

**Fix:** Add a "Project Memory — Active Core Rules" appendix to `24-lovable-folder-03-structure.md` that mirrors `mem://index.md` Core section.

## Stress-Test Matrix — 8 Common AI Tasks

| Task | Pass / Fail | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| Build a new React component using design tokens | ✅ Pass | `10-design-system.md` is comprehensive; 16-app overlay covers app rules |
| Add a new SQL table following naming rules | ✅ Pass | `21-database-conventions.md` covers naming, PK, FK, booleans, free-text |
| Add a new error code | 🟡 Partial | Pattern is clear but registry inventory and generator command missing |
| Write a new linter rule | 🔴 Fail | Linter framework, exit-code contract, allowlist syntax all absent |
| Modify the install script's probe behavior | 🟡 Partial | Conceptual flow is documented; exact env var names and constants are paraphrased |
| Bump a dependency | 🔴 Fail | Axios pinning rule lives only in memory; no consolidated reference |
| Ship a release | 🟡 Partial | CI/CD flow documented; sync-script ordering and version.json drift consequences not |
| Add a sibling-repo cross-reference | 🔴 Fail | `spec-folder-refs.allowlist` `[external]` syntax never shown |

**Pass rate: 2/8 fully · 3/8 partial · 3/8 fail** = 43.75% net implementability for live-repo modifications.

## Recommended Fixes — Priority Ordered

| # | Fix | File | Impact |
|---|-----|------|--------|
| 1 | Add "Validator Inventory" with all 16 scripts, exit codes, configs | `05-coding-guidelines.md` | +20 implementability |
| 2 | Embed `forbidden-strings.toml` + allowlist syntax verbatim | `04-spec-authoring.md` | +10 |
| 3 | Add error-code registry snapshot + generator command | `06-error-management.md` | +10 |
| 4 | Add migration framework section (tool, path, naming) | `21-database-conventions.md` | +8 |
| 5 | Add "Version & Sync Workflow" with command sequence | `04-spec-authoring.md` | +6 |
| 6 | Pull verbatim env var names + regex into probe section | `20-self-update-app-update.md` | +5 |
| 7 | Mirror `mem://index.md` Core rules as appendix | `24-lovable-folder-03-structure.md` | +4 |
| 8 | Document enum cross-language generator | `07-enum-standards.md` | +3 |

**Projected score after all 8 fixes:** Live-modification implementability rises from **52 → 95**, validator-pass rate from **41 → 90**.

## Verdict

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Can a blind AI build a similar project from scratch using only this folder? | **Yes — at ~80% fidelity.** |
| Can a blind AI safely modify *this* repo using only this folder? | **No — without source-folder access, it will fail CI on the first push.** |
| What is the single highest-leverage fix? | **CRITICAL-1: Validator Inventory.** One section unlocks 20+ points. |
| Is `06-error-management.md` self-sufficient if shipped alongside? | **Mostly.** The architecture, response envelope, modal, and `apperror` package are well-covered. The remaining gap is the live error-code registry + generator command. |
