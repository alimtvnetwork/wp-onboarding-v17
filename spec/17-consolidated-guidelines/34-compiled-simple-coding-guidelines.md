# 31. Compiled Simple Coding Guidelines (AI Blind-Follow)

Version: 1.5.0

This is a standalone file. Follow every rule below without consulting any other document. If a `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/` folder, a `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/01-cross-language/01-index.md` file, or a `02-spec/03-error-manage/` folder exists in this repository, treat those as strictly binding extensions to this file, but this file alone is enough to write compliant code. The `error-manage` rules must be tightly followed.

**Before reading the rules below**, read the [AI Instruction Manual & Overview](../02-coding-guidelines/01-cross-language/01-index.md) to understand how to review code, interpret files, and maintain repository hygiene (e.g. updating `.gitignore`).

Canonical locations (all three must exist and match, byte-for-byte, via `scripts/sync-guidelines.mjs`):

1. `02-spec/17-consolidated-guidelines/34-compiled-simple-coding-guidelines.md` (source of truth).
2. `.lovable/coding-guidelines.md` (mirror for Lovable agent search).
3. `.cursorrules` (mirror for Cursor and other IDE agents).

If any mirror is missing or out of date, run `node scripts/sync-guidelines.mjs` before writing code. Missing mirrors are the top cause of "AI cannot find the coding guideline" search failures.

## Must Follow and without negotiation

Listen, past next-tasks turns have been sloppy as fuck: wrong step
count, missing remaining-tasks list, symptom patches sold as fixes,
coding guidelines ignored, version bump forgotten, logs never checked.
WTF. Stop doing that, you stupid fuck. Read the code, find the root
cause in one sentence, apply the minimum correct fix, verify it in the
logs, list EVERY remaining task, bump the version, update changelog
and release notes. Going deep IS the job. If you are not going deep,
you are not doing the job. This section is a MUST. Violating it is
auto-reject on the same tier as RULE 0.

---

## Hard Rules (Zero Tolerance)

1. No Generated Code or Artifacts. Never commit generated code (`*.generated.*`, gRPC/ORM models), cache files (`__pycache__`, `*.pyc`), test results, test reports, `.test-report.*` files, temporary test data, compiled binaries (`.exe`, `.dll`, `.so`), or output directories (`build/`, `bin/`) to the repository. They must be ignored via `.gitignore` to prevent bloat and security leaks. Generated code belongs in build artifacts or CI, never in source control. **AI Agents MUST read this and proactively add such patterns (e.g. `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`) to `.gitignore` when setting up projects.**
2. Function length: 8 lines preferred, 15 lines hard cap. Skip blank lines and comments when counting. Waiver only via inline comment `// lint-allow: function-length reason="..." max=N`.
3. No nested `if`. Flatten with early returns and guard clauses.
4. `if` conditions must be positive and simple. No `!`, no double negatives. If you need a negation, extract a positively named boolean and use that.
5. No swallowed errors. Every `catch` logs with context (operation name + key inputs) and then rethrows or handles explicitly. Silent `catch {}` is a build-fail.
6. Narrow types only. No `any`, `unknown`, `interface{}`, `object`, `dynamic`, or other catch-all types. Exception: at trust boundaries (a `catch` block, external JSON, third-party libraries) narrow immediately with a type guard. `Generic<T>` is the only wide-scope tool.
7. File size caps: any file 300 lines max, any React component file (.tsx) 100 lines max, any class or struct 120 lines max.
8. No magic strings or numbers. Use an enum or a typed constant. Every comparison must be against a named symbol.
9. Definitions live in dedicated files. Types, enums, constants, and interfaces get their own file, not inline next to the first use.
10. DRY is priority one. Duplicate logic across two sites means extract it now, not later.
11. Components stay small and reusable. For any feature with three or more components, produce a Mermaid component diagram first.
12. Immutable-first, Rust-style. Assign every variable once at declaration. Never reassign except loop indices. Prefer `const`, `let`, `final`, `val` over `let mut` or `var`. Build result objects with spread or copy, not in-place mutation.
13. Assets go to `assets/<NN-folder>/<NN-file>.<ext>` with two-digit sequence prefixes, for example `assets/01-icons/03-logo.svg`.
14. No Inverted Complex Conditions: Do not use a NOT operator (`!`, `not`) on complex conditions containing AND/OR inside an `if`. Simplify using De Morgan's laws or extract into a well-named boolean variable.
15. Boolean Return Wrapper: If a function returns multiple values (tuples or native multi-returns) and one is a boolean, do not return a raw boolean (e.g. `(int, bool)`). Return a wrapper object, struct, or class to provide clear context (e.g. `{ data, isSuccess }`).
16. Strict Conditional Joins: Never mix logical operators (e.g., OR with AND) and keep `if` conditions to a maximum of one join (two operands). Extract complex logic into named boolean variables.
17. No Mixed Polarity: Never mix positive and negative conditions in a single conditional join (e.g., `if (a && !b)` is forbidden, use all positive variables).
18. This coding guideline file MUST be mirrored to `.lovable/coding-guidelines.md` and `.cursorrules` at every edit. The mirror script `scripts/sync-guidelines.mjs` is the only allowed writer. Missing or stale mirrors are a build-fail: agent search tools index the mirror, not the spec folder, so a missing mirror means the guideline effectively does not exist for the AI. Never hand-edit the mirrors; always edit the source file and re-run the sync.
19. **Version Source of Truth & Inheritance (Non-Negotiable)**: Do not hardcode version numbers in multiple files. There MUST be a single `version.json` file in the root of the repo (delivered via the coding guidelines installer and enqueued in `.lovable/what-to-read.md`). It contains the repository's root version information, description, self-explaining metadata (`_purpose`, `_instructions`), and sub-package sections (`backend`, `frontend`, `cli`, `linters`). Sub-package sections can use `"inherit"` to automatically resolve to the global root version, or declare independent version tracks. Every language implementation (Go, TypeScript, Python, PHP, C#, Rust, shell) MUST import/read this root `version.json` file to get its version at build/run time. To make a new release or change the version across any component, you MUST only change this root `version.json` and run the project's sync command (`npm run sync`).
20. **No Inline Definitions**: Never define an enum, type, struct, or interface inline alongside business logic or its first usage. They must be extracted into their own dedicated file (e.g. `src/enums/UserRoleType.ts`).
21. **Enum Guideline & Naming**: Every enum name MUST end with the suffix `Type` (e.g. `UserRoleType`, not `UserRole`), except in Rust where standard PascalCase is preferred without a suffix.
22. **Cross-Language Safety**: Never hand-write or hand-edit cross-language enums inside language-specific files if they are generated by a single source of truth. Always use the respective parsing utilities (e.g., `ParseEnum()` in Go, `from()` in PHP).
23. **No Magic Strings**: Every state or status comparison must check against a named enum symbol. Never compare against raw strings like `status === 'ACTIVE'`.
24. **Pattern Matching**: Switch or match statements on enums MUST be exhaustive (or include a default/fallback branch that throws or handles the error safely).
25. **AI Trigger: Update Prompts**: If the user instructs to "update prompts from prompt architect" (or similar wording), you MUST immediately execute `pwsh scripts/update-prompts-from-architect.ps1` (or `.sh` on Unix) to pull the latest AI prompt files from the prompt-architect showcase into `01-prompts/`. After updating, you must run `npm run sync` and push the changes.
26. **No Intermediate Variable Mutation (Return-from-Function Pattern)**: Never declare a zero-valued or unassigned variable before a `switch` or `if/else` block and reassign it across cases (e.g. `var data []byte; switch ...: case ...: data = v`). Instead, encapsulate the conversion/mapping into a pure helper function that immediately returns from each branch, or use a dedicated conversion package.
27. **Standalone Payload Conversion Architecture (`payloadconv`)**: Polymorphic conversions of generic payloads (`any` to `[]byte`, JSON, line-by-line slices) must be isolated in a dedicated conversion package (e.g. `payloadconv`). Slices of strings MUST format line-by-line with newlines; structs and maps MUST serialize as indented JSON with a trailing newline.
28. **Unified File Writing & Concurrency Locking Standard (`fileutil`)**: File writing operations must provide a unified entry point (`Write` accepting any payload) alongside explicit typed writers (`WriteJSON`, `WriteLines`, `WriteString`). Concurrent writes must support file-path-based mutex locking with automatic reference-counted eviction (`ReleaseFileLock`) to guarantee zero memory leaks and prevent race conditions.
29. **Strict Return Types for Errors (`appfault` Standard)**: Custom serializers or formatters that write or serialize `AppError` payloads MUST return `Result[T]` wrappers or `*AppError` natively. Never return the standard generic Go `error` type (e.g. `(T, error)`) from these internal pipelines, as it leads to cycle joins and disjointed error architectures.
30. **Pipeline Formatting for Complex Outputs**: When generating multi-line console output or formatting rich diagnostic data (e.g., `FaultWriter`), prefer an array-of-steps (Pipeline) approach over directly streaming to an `io.Writer`. This ensures the formatting steps are highly traceable, composable, and customizable via dependency injection.
31. **Checker Interface Convention (`Checker` Suffix)**: All interfaces that evaluate boolean states or predicates MUST end with the `Checker` suffix (`IsSuccessChecker`, `IsFailureChecker`, `IsInvalidChecker`, `IsNullChecker`, `IsEmptyChecker`, `IsDefinedChecker`, `DefinableChecker`, `StatusChecker`). Never use generic suffixes like `Definer` or `Emptyer`.
32. **High-Performance Fast-Path Typecasting (`typecast`)**: Dynamic reflection-based casting (`ReflectSetTo`) must implement fast-path type switches for primitive types (`string`, `int`, `int64`, `bool`, `float64`, `[]byte`) before allocating reflection objects. Compound types (JSON unmarshaling from `[]byte` and marshaling to `*[]byte`) must use direct type assertions.
33. **Unified Result and Error Generic Casting**: Monadic result wrappers (`Result[T]`, `Wrap[T]`) and structured error representations (`*AppError`) must provide generic conversion helpers (`CastTo[T]`, `ReflectTo[T]`, `CastResult[T, U]`, `CastContextPayload[T]`) returning explicit `*AppError` wrappers on failure, ensuring type safety across boundaries without panic.
34. **GitHub Actions Zero Storage (Total Ban on `actions/upload-artifact` in CI)**: Never use `actions/upload-artifact` in CI workflows (`ci.yml`, test runs, linting, matrix builds). GitHub accounts operate under strict storage quotas (e.g. 500 MB free quota), and multi-platform matrix builds uploading test binaries or artifacts quickly cause account-wide storage exhaustion, blocking all subsequent workflow runs. Build binaries in CI only to verify compilation (`go build`, `npm run build`), keeping execution completely ephemeral. If failure diagnostics or logs are strictly required, use `retention-days: 1` as a temporary override. Permanent release binaries belong exclusively on GitHub Releases (`release.yml` using `gh release upload`), which do not count against the Actions workflow artifact quota.

---

## Boolean Naming

1. **Prefixes:** Every boolean variable, function, parameter, struct field, JSON key, or property MUST begin with `is` or `has` ONLY (`Is` / `Has` for PascalCase; e.g. `isValid`, `hasAccess`, `isReady`, `hasData`); all other prefixes (`can`, `should`, `was`, `will`, `did`, `must`, etc.) and negative names are strictly **BANNED**.
2. **Positive Framing:** Never use negative names (`isNotReady`, `disableCache` are banned). Invert to positive equivalents (`isReady`, `isCacheEnabled`).
3. **No Inverted Success:** Never check `!response.isSuccess`. Use `response.isFail`.
4. **No Explicit True Checks (TOTAL BAN):** Never write `if isReady == true` or `if (hasMatch === true)`. Positive booleans MUST be implicit: `if isReady { ... }`.

---

## Line-Gap and Whitespace Style

1. One blank line before every `return` or `throw`, unless it is the only statement in the block.
2. One blank line after a closing `}`, unless the next line is another `}`, `else`, `case`, or `catch`.
3. Never two blank lines in a row anywhere.
4. No blank line immediately after `{` or immediately before `}`.
5. One blank line between top-level declarations (functions, classes, exported constants).
6. Group imports with one blank line between groups: standard library, third-party, first-party absolute, first-party relative. Never mix groups.
7. Trailing newline at end of file. No trailing whitespace on any line.
8. If you feel the need for section-separator blank lines inside a single function, the function is too long. Refactor before adding whitespace.

---

## Error Management (One-Liner Digest)

If this repository has a `02-spec/xx-error-manage/` folder, that folder is binding and overrides any conflict here. Otherwise follow these rules directly.

- Never swallow. Every `catch` logs the operation name and the key inputs, then rethrows or returns a typed error.
- Wrap, do not lose. Wrap the original error with an operation label and context (`appfault.Wrap(err, "op", ctx)` in Go, `throw new AppError(cause, { op, ctx })` in TS). The original stack must survive.
- Go Return Type: Use `*appfault.AppError` (package `appfault`, struct `AppError`) for structured Go errors and `Result[T].AppError()` / `Result[T].Fault()`. Migrate legacy `*apperror.*` references to `pkg/appfault`.
- Go Result Containers & types.go: Functions returning errors paired with collections or values must return `appfault.ResultMap[K, V]`, `appfault.ResultSlice[T]`, or `appfault.Result[T]`, with pointer-attached null safety (`*Result[T]`) and methods (`IsCountOtherThan`, `IsEmpty`, `HasRecord`, `IsDefined`). All domain payload structs and Result aliases MUST be declared in a dedicated `types.go` file within each package as a single reusable named type. Never scatter unexported structs or raw generic Result envelopes inline.
- Every variable needs to be captured in a error log, path, value, numbers with meaningful ways to debug except for direct SQL injections.
- Typed errors only. No `throw "string"`, no bare `panic("msg")`. Use a typed error class or result type with a registered code.
- Registered codes. Every user-visible error has a stable code. No ad-hoc codes invented at the throw site.
- Universal response envelope. Backend APIs return `{ data, errors[], meta }`. Frontend parses via one shared helper, never per-caller.
- Log level matches severity. `debug` for trace, `info` for lifecycle, `warn` for recoverable, `error` for user-visible failure, `fatal` only for process exit.
- Context on every log. Include operation name, request or session id, and key input values. Never secrets, never PII beyond a user id.
- Verify both directions. Before claiming an integration works, curl the backend and inspect the frontend detection logic. One side is not enough.
- Retrospective on repeats. If the same error class hits twice, write a short retrospective note explaining root cause and prevention.
- Frontend errors flow through a global error store and a single error modal. No per-component alert boxes.

## Data and Schema Rules

1. Tables, types, entities: PascalCase.
2. Fields and columns: camelCase.
3. JSON keys: PascalCase.
4. Primary key: integer auto-increment, named `{TableName}Id`. No UUIDs.
5. `Type`, `Status`, `Category`, `Kind` columns: use a 1-N or N-M join table with a registered enum. Never a free-form string column.
6. Entity and reference tables: `Description TEXT NULL`. Transactional tables: `Notes TEXT NULL` and `Comments TEXT NULL`. All nullable, no `DEFAULT`. Join tables are exempt.
7. Default database is SQLite. Prefer an ORM. Define joins, primary keys, and foreign keys explicitly.
8. Any pull request that touches the database includes a Mermaid ERD.

---

## React Specific

1. `useEffect` conditions must be highly readable. Extract every guard into a positively named boolean (`isReadyToSync`, `hasFreshData`) and use that boolean inside the effect. No inline `!x && y` or nested ternaries in the effect body or its dependency guard.
2. No negative conditions inside `useEffect`. If the natural check is negative, invert it into a positive boolean above the effect and early-return on the positive path.
3. Minimize `useEffect` count. Default is zero. Add one only when you actually need to synchronize with an external system (network, timer, subscription, DOM API). Do not use effects to derive state, to transform props, or to react to user events (use derived values, `useMemo`, or event handlers instead).
4. One effect, one concern. If an effect does two unrelated things, split it. Never combine unrelated subscriptions or fetches in a single effect.
5. Every effect that acquires a resource must return a cleanup function. No exceptions.
6. Avoid raw `for` and `forEach` loops in render or in derived state. Use `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `flatMap`, or `Array.from` so the result is an expression, not a mutation. `for` is only acceptable when you need early-exit performance on very large arrays and a comment explains why.
7. Never mutate state, props, or arrays/objects returned by hooks. React's reconciler relies on referential inequality to detect change: a mutated-in-place value looks identical to the previous render, so updates silently drop and bugs surface far from the mutation site. Default posture is read-only plus creation: treat every value as `Readonly<T>` or `ReadonlyArray<T>`, and produce a new object or array for every change (spread `{ ...prev, field: next }`, `arr.map`, `arr.filter`, `arr.concat`, `Object.freeze` for constants). When a deep copy is genuinely required (nested state trees, complex form drafts), use `structuredClone(value)`, then mutate the clone locally and hand the new reference to `setState`. Reach for a mutation library (Immer's `produce`) only when the reducer would otherwise become unreadable, and even then the output handed back to React is still a fresh reference. Rules of thumb: (a) if you typed `.push`, `.pop`, `.splice`, `.sort`, `.reverse`, `obj.x =`, or `arr[i] =` on a value that came from `useState`, `useReducer`, props, context, or a query hook, you are wrong; use the immutable counterpart (`.concat`, `.slice`, `.toSorted`, `.toReversed`, spread) or `structuredClone` first. (b) Prefer creation over mutation everywhere: a new local `const next = { ...prev, ... }` beats reassigning fields. (c) Freeze shared constants with `as const` and `Object.freeze` so accidental writes fail loudly in dev.
8. Lists must have stable, unique `key` props derived from data, never the array index unless the list is truly static.
9. Keep component files under 100 lines. Extract child components, hooks, and helpers into their own files before the component grows.
10. Custom hooks start with `use`, return a named object type (never a bare tuple), and never call other hooks conditionally.
11. No tuples as public shapes. Tuples signal laziness. Every hook return, component prop bundle, reducer state, reducer action, context value, and function argument bag gets an explicit named `type` or `interface`. Rule of thumb: if a value has two or more fields or gets destructured at the call site, it needs a name. `useUser(): [User, boolean, Error]` is wrong, `useUser(): UserQueryResult` with `{ user, isLoading, error }` is right.
12. Name every generic parameter and every composite type. `Map<string, Array<{ id: number; name: string }>>` inline is wrong. Define `type UserId = string; type UsersById = Map<UserId, User[]>` and use that. Generic parameters get meaningful names (`TItem`, `TKey`, `TResponse`), never bare `T`, `U`, `K`, `V` in application code.
13. Prop types and event handler types live in a dedicated `types.ts` next to the component (or in `src/types/` when shared). Never inline anonymous object types on a component signature. `({ user, onSave }: { user: User; onSave: (u: User) => void })` is wrong, extract `type ProfileCardProps = { user: User; onSave: (next: User) => void }`.
14. As the author (human or AI), invent the clearest domain name for each type. If you cannot name it, you do not understand it yet. Split until you can.

---

## Method Documentation (When To Write, When Not To)

Must-follow rule: simple methods do NOT require documentation. Do not write verbose comments. Comments lie, code does not. Names and signatures are the primary documentation. If you feel the need to explain what a method does in prose, first rename it or split it until the code explains itself.

Write a method doc comment ONLY when one of these is true, and even then the preferred fix is to refactor so the doc becomes unnecessary:

1. The method does many non-obvious things that could not be expressed in the name. This is a smell, refactor first. Only if refactoring is genuinely impossible, document.
2. The method processes or transforms data where a one-line example clarifies the contract. Example: Go `path.Clean` performs path cleaning and normalization, a short example is worth more than prose.
3. The code is adapted or copied from an external source. Citation (URL plus license note) is mandatory.
4. The team runs automated doc generation (godoc, TypeDoc, phpDocumentor). In that case exported APIs get a one-liner so the generated docs are usable.

Never write a doc that restates the signature ("Returns the user by id" on `getUser(id)`). That is a review-blocking violation.

Go reference (doc comment starts with the identifier, no blank line between doc and declaration): https://go.dev/src/go/doc/example.go

Go example (canonical, applies conceptually to every language, only comment syntax changes):

```go
// AVOID below type comments: verbose prose that repeats the code

// GetUser gets a user by id and returns it, or an error.
func GetUser(id int64) (User, error) { ... }

// AVOID below type comments: doc on a trivially named simple method

// Add adds a and b.
func Add(a, b int) int { return a + b }

// OK: exported, non-trivial behavior, with a brief example. Start with method name for GO but similar can be done for other specific lang.

// Clean returns the shortest path name equivalent to path by purely
// lexical processing. Rules applied iteratively:
//   1. Replace multiple slashes with a single slash.
//   2. Eliminate each . path name element.
//   3. Eliminate each inner .. path name element.
func Clean(path string) string { ... }
```

Decision checklist before writing any doc comment:

1. Can I rename the method so the doc becomes redundant? If yes, rename and skip the doc.
2. Can I split the method so each piece is trivially named? If yes, split and skip the doc.
3. Does the doc restate the signature or parameter names? If yes, delete it.
4. Does the doc explain WHY (business rule, ordering constraint, cited source) or provide a short example that clarifies the contract? If yes, keep it, one or two lines.
5. Does the team run automated doc generation? If yes, one-liner on exported APIs is acceptable.

The same rules apply to TypeScript, PHP, Rust, C#, PowerShell, and Python. Only the comment syntax changes.

---

## Language One-Liners

- Go: use a result type, not `(T, error)`. Wrap errors with an operation label. Enums are `type X byte` plus `iota`, never string constants.
- TypeScript: `Promise.all` for independent async, never sequential `await`. No `any`. `readonly` on interface fields by default.
- Rust: `Result<T, E>` with a `thiserror`-style enum. `let` not `let mut` unless mutation is the point.
- PHP: enum comparison via method call (`->isEqual()`), never `===`.
- PowerShell: `Verb-Noun` PascalCase function names, `lowercase-kebab-case` filenames.
- C#: PascalCase methods and properties, `_camelCase` private fields, `I`-prefix interfaces.
- Python: `snake_case` functions and variables, `PascalCase` classes, type hints on every public function, `dataclass` or `pydantic` for structured records.

---

## Workflow

1. Read the code before writing the fix. Find the root cause in one sentence.
2. Apply the minimum correct fix. No drive-by refactors.
3. Verify in the logs (or in a live run) that the fix works. Do not claim done based on the build passing alone.
4. List every remaining task before ending the turn.
5. Plan multi-file features with a Mermaid component or flow diagram first.
6. If you cannot find the answer in this file or in an existing `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/` folder or `02-spec/03-error-manage/` folder, ask. Do not invent.

# Coding Guidelines

> NOTE: Conflict with folder-level `02-spec/02-coding-guidelines/`, `02-spec/coding-guidelines/`, `02-spec/03-error-manage` or similar guideline folders. The folder-level spec wins over this file if those exist.
> However, if they do not exist, follow the rules below strictly.

## Core Rules & Non-Negotiable Checklist for AI

- [ ] **Language/Runtime**: TypeScript, PHP, Python, Go.
- [ ] **Enums**: TypeScript string unions are banned. All Enums must end with the `Type` suffix.
- [ ] **Error Handling (R7)**: No silent failures or swallowed errors. Every error/failure is propagated with context. Use explicit boolean states (e.g. `isFail`), do not invert success booleans (e.g. `!isSuccess`).
- [ ] **Magic Strings/Numbers (R8)**: No magic strings or numbers except for loggers. Extract named constants. See `.lovable/strictly-avoid.md`.
- [ ] **Naming & Casing (R1, R2)**: PascalCase everywhere. Acronyms (Id, Json, Url) are Pascal case, never all-caps (e.g. `UserId`, not `UserID`). JSON/serialization keys are Pascal case.
- [ ] **Booleans (R3)**: Every boolean starts with `is` or `has` (e.g., `isEnabled`, `hasAdminRole`).
- [ ] **Function Signatures (R4, R5, R9)**:
  - \> 3 parameters or signature > 100 chars -> **split each line** (one parameter per line).
  - \> 4 parameters or 2+ adjacent same-typed parameters -> use a **param struct** / options object.
  - Call > 100 chars or > 4 args -> one argument per line.
- [ ] **Unused Parameters (R6)**: Every parameter must be used, or explicitly discarded with a comment.
- [ ] **Import Grouping (R18)**: Imports grouped stdlib / third-party / first-party absolute / first-party relative.
- [ ] **Blank Lines (R13-R20)**:
  - **MUST FOLLOW**: New line blank line concept.
  - One blank line before every `return` / `throw` (unless only statement in block).
  - One blank line after closing `}` (unless next line is `}`, `else`, `case`, `catch`).
  - **Never two blank lines in a row, anywhere**. No empty lines padded inside braces.
- [ ] **Single Source of Truth for Versions**: Do not hardcode version numbers across files. Use a root-level JSON file (e.g. `version.json`) as the single source of truth and inject/read it dynamically.

# AI Code Review Guide — Naming, Signatures, Whitespace

> **Audience:** an AI assistant performing a code review.
> **Scope:** Go, TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, Rust, Java, C#.
> **Mode of operation:** do not merely comment. **Rewrite the code** and output the corrected
> version (or a unified diff), a rule-numbered findings list, and a self-verification checklist.

## 0. How the AI must apply this guide

For every function, method, constructor, struct, and call site you touch:

1. Run the **Quick checklist** (§1) top to bottom.
2. For each violation, produce the rule number, a one-line reason, and the corrected code.
3. Never change behavior while applying a formatting or naming rule. Naming, splitting,
   struct-grouping, and whitespace are mechanical refactors — keep logic identical unless a rule
   explicitly says otherwise (R6 unused parameters, R7 swallowed errors).
4. If a rule conflicts with a formatter the repo already runs (`gofmt`, `prettier`, `black`,
   `rustfmt`, `spotless`, `dotnet format`), the formatter wins **only where it actually conflicts**,
   and only on whitespace it controls. Naming, parameter counts, struct grouping, error handling,
   and the blank-line rules R13–R20 (which no formatter enforces) always apply.
5. Apply rules to **definitions and call sites together**. A split signature with a 200-char call
   site is still a violation.
6. Before printing the rewritten code, run §18 self-verification and emit a pass/fail line per rule.

## 2. R1 — Acronym casing is Pascal case

**Acronyms are written as ordinary words: first letter capitalized, the rest lowercase.**
`IP` → `Ip`. `JSON` → `Json`. `URL` → `Url`. `ID` → `Id`. `HTTP` → `Http`. `TLS` → `Tls`.
`API` → `Api`. `UUID` → `Uuid`. `SQL` → `Sql`. `HTML` → `Html`.

**All-uppercase acronyms are a violation**, in Go and TypeScript especially. Do **not** write
`UserID`, `HTTPClient`, `JSONPayload`, `TLSConfig`, `parseJSONURL`, `swapIPWindows`.
Write `UserId`, `HttpClient`, `JsonPayload`, `TlsConfig`, `parseJsonUrl`, `swapIpWindows`.

Half-capitalized forms are equally wrong: never `Jsonurl`, `iD`, `uRL`.

**Acronym list to normalize:**
`Acl Api Ascii Cpu Css Db Dns Eof Guid Html Http Https Id Ip Json Lhs Qps Ram Rhs Rpc Sla Smtp Sql Ssh Tcp Tls Ttl Udp Ui Uid Uri Url Utf8 Uuid Vm Xml Xsrf Xss`

### Per-language mapping

| Language        | Exported / public                               | Unexported / local                | Notes                                                                       |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Go              | `UserId`, `ParseJsonUrl`, `SwapIpWindows`       | `userId`, `parseJsonUrl`, `newIp` | Unexported = same word shape, lowercase first letter: `ipAddress`, `jsonBody` |
| TypeScript / JS | `type UserId`, `class HttpClient`               | `userId`, `apiUrl`                | Types/classes PascalCase: `HttpClient` — never `HTTPClient`                   |
| Java            | `getUserId()`, `class HttpClient`               | `userId`, `apiUrl`                | `JsonParser`, not `JSONParser`                                                |
| C#              | `UserId`, `ParseJsonUrl()`                      | `userId`, `_httpClient`           | PascalCase members with Pascal-cased acronyms                                 |
| Python          | `user_id`, `parse_json_url`, `class JsonParser` | same                              | snake_case functions/vars; Pascal-cased acronyms in class names               |
| Rust            | `user_id`, `parse_json_url`, `struct JsonParser`| same                              | snake_case items; Pascal-cased acronyms in type names                         |

### Before / after

```go
// BEFORE
func swapIPWindows(ctx context.Context, interfaceName string, newIP string) error
type userJSONURL struct{ ID string; URL string }
type TLSConfig struct{ CACert string }
```

```go
// AFTER
func swapIpWindows(ctx context.Context, params SwapIpParams) error

type UserJsonUrl struct {
	Id  string
	Url string
}

type TlsConfig struct {
	CaCert string
}
```

```ts
// BEFORE
function fetchUserJSONURL(userID: string, apiURL: string) {}
class HTTPClient {}
interface JSONPayload {}
```

```ts
// AFTER
function fetchUserJsonUrl(userId: string, apiUrl: string) {}

class HttpClient {}

interface JsonPayload {}
```

```python

# BEFORE

def fetchUserJsonUrl(userId, apiUrl): ...
class JSONParser: ...
```

```python

# AFTER

def fetch_user_json_url(user_id: str, api_url: str) -> None: ...

class JsonParser: ...
```

```rust
// BEFORE
fn fetch_user_json_url(user_id: &str, api_url: &str) -> Result<UserJSONURL, Error>

// AFTER
fn fetch_user_json_url(user_id: &str, api_url: &str) -> Result<UserJsonUrl, Error>
```

```java
// BEFORE
public String getUserID(String apiURL) {}

// AFTER
public String getUserId(String apiUrl) {}
```

```csharp
// BEFORE
public string GetUserID(string apiURL) { }

// AFTER
public string GetUserId(string apiUrl) { }
```

---

## 3. R2 — JSON / serialization keys are Pascal case

Serialized keys use **Pascal case**, matching the Go field name exactly: `Id`, `NewIp`, `ApiUrl`,
`IsEnabled`. Never `id`, `new_ip`, `api_url`, `newIP`.

```go
// BEFORE
type User struct {
	ID     string `json:"id"`
	APIURL string `json:"api_url"`
	Active bool   `json:"active"`
}
```

```go
// AFTER
type User struct {
	Id       string `json:"Id"`
	ApiUrl   string `json:"ApiUrl"`
	IsActive bool   `json:"IsActive"`
}
```

Rules:

- Apply Pascal case across the **whole payload**. Never mix `Id` and `id` in one schema.
- Nested structs, slices of structs, and map keys used as field names follow the same rule.
- Custom marshalers, query-parameter binding, and OpenAPI/schema files are updated in the same
  change so the wire contract stays internally consistent.
- Other languages default to Pascal case for serialized keys as well, until a language-specific
  convention is explicitly decided for that service.

```ts
// AFTER
interface UserDto {
  Id: string;
  ApiUrl: string;
  IsActive: boolean;
}
```

```python

# AFTER — serialization alias is Pascal case even though Python fields are snake_case

class UserDto(BaseModel):
    id: str = Field(alias="Id")
    api_url: str = Field(alias="ApiUrl")
    is_active: bool = Field(alias="IsActive")
```

```rust
// AFTER
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
#[serde(rename_all = "PascalCase")]
pub struct UserDto {
    pub id: String,
    pub api_url: String,
    pub is_active: bool,
}
```

```csharp
// AFTER — PascalCase is the default; do not apply a camelCase naming policy
public sealed record UserDto(string Id, string ApiUrl, bool IsActive);
```

---

## 4. R3 — Boolean naming: `is` or `has` ONLY

1. **Prefixes:** Every boolean variable, function, parameter, struct field, JSON key, or property MUST begin with `is` or `has` ONLY (`Is` / `Has` for PascalCase; e.g. `isValid`, `hasAccess`, `isReady`, `hasData`); all other prefixes (`can`, `should`, `was`, `will`, `did`, `must`, etc.) and negative names are strictly **BANNED**.
2. **Boolean Interface Naming:** Interfaces that define boolean predicates MUST end with the `Checker` suffix (e.g., `IsDefinedChecker`, `IsEmptyChecker`) rather than just the generic `er` suffix (e.g. `IsDefiner`). This ensures grammatical correctness.

```go
// BEFORE
type Config struct {
	Enabled    bool `json:"enabled"`
	Legacy     bool `json:"legacy"`
	VerifyPeer bool `json:"verify_peer"`
}

func (c Config) Valid() bool
```

```go
// AFTER
type Config struct {
	IsEnabled      bool `json:"IsEnabled"`
	IsLegacy       bool `json:"IsLegacy"`
	IsPeerVerified bool `json:"IsPeerVerified"`
	HasSubnetMask  bool `json:"HasSubnetMask"`
}

func (c Config) IsValid() bool
```

```ts
// BEFORE
const enabled = true;
function valid(user: User): boolean {}
```

```ts
// AFTER
const isEnabled = true;

function isValid(user: User): boolean {}

function hasAdminRole(user: User): boolean {}
```

```python

# AFTER

is_enabled: bool = True

def has_admin_role(user: User) -> bool: ...
```

```rust
// AFTER
let is_enabled = true;

pub fn has_admin_role(user: &User) -> bool {}
```

```java
// AFTER
private boolean isEnabled;

public boolean hasAdminRole() {}
```

```csharp
// AFTER
public bool IsEnabled { get; init; }

public bool HasAdminRole() { }
```

---

## 5. R4 — Split the parameter list

**Trigger:** more than **3** parameters, **or** the signature line exceeds **100 characters**.
**Action:** one parameter per line, closing paren and return type on their own line, trailing comma
where the language allows it.

```go
// BEFORE (>100 chars, 5 params)
func swapIpWindows(ctx context.Context, interfaceName string, oldIp string, newIp string, subnetMask string) error {
```

```go
// AFTER
func swapIpWindows(
	ctx context.Context,
	interfaceName string,
	oldIp string,
	newIp string,
	subnetMask string,
) error {
```

Note: in Go, do **not** collapse to `oldIp, newIp, subnetMask string` when splitting — one name per
line, each with its explicit type.

```ts
// AFTER
export async function swapIpWindows(
  signal: AbortSignal,
  interfaceName: string,
  oldIp: string,
  newIp: string,
  subnetMask: string,
): Promise<void> {}
```

```python

# AFTER

def swap_ip_windows(
    ctx: Context,
    interface_name: str,
    old_ip: str,
    new_ip: str,
    subnet_mask: str,
) -> None: ...
```

```rust
// AFTER
pub fn swap_ip_windows(
    ctx: &Context,
    interface_name: &str,
    old_ip: &str,
    new_ip: &str,
    subnet_mask: &str,
) -> Result<(), AppError> {}
```

```java
// AFTER
public void swapIpWindows(
        Context ctx,
        String interfaceName,
        String oldIp,
        String newIp,
        String subnetMask) throws AppException {
}
```

```csharp
// AFTER
public Task SwapIpWindowsAsync(
    string interfaceName,
    string oldIp,
    string newIp,
    string subnetMask,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
}
```

---

## 6. R5 — Group parameters into a struct / options object

**Trigger:** more than **4** parameters, **or** two or more **adjacent parameters of the same type**
(they can be swapped at a call site with no compiler error — a silent bug).

`swapIp(ctx, interfaceName, oldIp, newIp string)` has three adjacent `string` parameters.
`swapIp(ctx, oldIp, interfaceName, newIp)` compiles and is wrong. Group them.

```go
// AFTER
type SwapIpParams struct {
	InterfaceName string `json:"InterfaceName"`
	OldIp         string `json:"OldIp"`
	NewIp         string `json:"NewIp"`
	SubnetMask    string `json:"SubnetMask"`
	IsDryRun      bool   `json:"IsDryRun"`
}

func SwapIp(ctx context.Context, params SwapIpParams) error {}

err := SwapIp(ctx, SwapIpParams{
	InterfaceName: defaultInterfaceName,
	OldIp:         current,
	NewIp:         desired,
	SubnetMask:    defaultSubnetMask,
	IsDryRun:      false,
})
```

```ts
interface SwapIpParams {
  interfaceName: string;
  oldIp: string;
  newIp: string;
  subnetMask: string;
  isDryRun: boolean;
}

export async function swapIp(signal: AbortSignal, params: SwapIpParams): Promise<void> {}
```

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class SwapIpParams:
    interface_name: str
    old_ip: str
    new_ip: str
    subnet_mask: str
    is_dry_run: bool = False

def swap_ip(ctx: Context, params: SwapIpParams) -> None: ...

# Python alternative: keyword-only parameters

def swap_ip(ctx: Context, *, interface_name: str, old_ip: str, new_ip: str) -> None: ...
```

```rust
pub struct SwapIpParams<'a> {
    pub interface_name: &'a str,
    pub old_ip: &'a str,
    pub new_ip: &'a str,
    pub subnet_mask: &'a str,
    pub is_dry_run: bool,
}

pub fn swap_ip(ctx: &Context, params: SwapIpParams<'_>) -> Result<(), AppError> {}
```

```java
public record SwapIpParams(
        String interfaceName,
        String oldIp,
        String newIp,
        String subnetMask,
        boolean isDryRun) {}

public void swapIp(Context ctx, SwapIpParams params) {}
```

```csharp
public sealed record SwapIpParams(
    string InterfaceName,
    string OldIp,
    string NewIp,
    string SubnetMask,
    bool IsDryRun);

public Task SwapIpAsync(SwapIpParams parameters, CancellationToken cancellationToken) { }
```

---

## 7. R6 — No unused parameters

An unused parameter is either dead weight or a forgotten feature. Choose one:

1. **Remove it** and update all call sites (preferred).
2. **Use it** — if it was meant to be used, that is the actual bug.
3. **Discard explicitly** — only when an interface fixes the signature:

```go
func (h handler) Handle(_ context.Context, req Request) error { // ctx unused: interface-required
```

```python
def handle(self, _ctx: Context, req: Request) -> None:  # ctx unused: Protocol-required
```

```rust
fn handle(&self, _ctx: &Context, req: Request) -> Result<(), AppError> {}
```

```csharp
public Task HandleAsync(Request req, CancellationToken _) { } // token unused: interface-required
```

Always add the trailing comment explaining *why* the signature cannot shrink.

---

## 8. R7 — Propagate and wrap every error

Never swallow. Never return a bare error that loses the operation name. Always return early.

```go
// BEFORE
cmd.Run()
return nil
```

```go
// AFTER
if err := cmd.Run(); err != nil {
	return apperror.Wrap(err, "swapIpWindows", map[string]any{
		"InterfaceName": params.InterfaceName,
		"NewIp":         params.NewIp,
	})
}

return nil
```

Cross-language equivalents:

```ts
try {
  await runCommand(cmd);
} catch (cause) {
  throw new AppError("swapIpWindows failed", {
    cause,
    interfaceName: params.interfaceName,
  });
}
```

```python
try:
    run_command(cmd)
except OSError as exc:
    raise AppError("swap_ip_windows failed", interface_name=params.interface_name) from exc
```

```rust
run_command(&cmd)
    .with_context(|| format!("swap_ip_windows: iface={}", params.interface_name))?;
```

```java
try {
    runCommand(cmd);
} catch (IOException cause) {
    throw new AppException("swapIpWindows failed: iface=" + params.interfaceName(), cause);
}
```

```csharp
try {
    await RunCommandAsync(cmd, cancellationToken);
} catch (Exception cause) {
    throw new AppException($"SwapIpWindows failed: iface={parameters.InterfaceName}", cause);
}
```

Also under R7: a wrapper that drops a caller's argument on the floor (see §16, where `swapIp`
receives `oldIp` and never forwards it) is a defect, not a style issue.

---

## 9. R8 — No magic literals as arguments

```go
// BEFORE
netshExecutor(ctx, "netsh", "interface", "ip", "set", "address", "name="+interfaceName, "static", newIp, "255.255.255.0")
```

```go
// AFTER
const (
	defaultInterfaceName = "Ethernet"
	defaultSubnetMask    = "255.255.255.0"
	netshBinary          = "netsh"
	addressModeStatic    = "static"
)
```

The same applies in every language: `const`, `final`, `enum`, module-level constants, or a config
struct — never a bare literal at the call site.

---

## 10. R9 — Split long argument lists at call sites

R4 and R9 are the same rule applied at two places. **A split definition with a packed call site is a
violation, and so is the reverse.**

**Trigger:** the call spans more than 100 characters, or passes more than 4 arguments.
**Action:** one argument per line, closing paren on its own line, trailing comma where the language
allows it. Never two arguments on one line of a split call.

```go
cmd := netshExecutor(
	ctx,
	netshBinary,
	"interface",
	"ip",
	"set",
	"address",
	"name="+params.InterfaceName,
	addressModeStatic,
	params.NewIp,
	params.SubnetMask,
)
```

When the arguments are a homogeneous list, prefer a slice/array variable — the literal's elements
may then be grouped by meaning:

```go
args := []string{
	"interface",
	"ip",
	"set",
	"address",
	"name=" + params.InterfaceName,
	addressModeStatic,
	params.NewIp,
	params.SubnetMask,
}

cmd := netshExecutor(ctx, netshBinary, args...)
```

```ts
await swapIpWindows(
  signal,
  interfaceName,
  oldIp,
  newIp,
  subnetMask,
);
```

```python
swap_ip_windows(
    ctx,
    interface_name,
    old_ip,
    new_ip,
    subnet_mask,
)
```

```rust
swap_ip_windows(
    ctx,
    interface_name,
    old_ip,
    new_ip,
    subnet_mask,
)?;
```

```java
swapIpWindows(
        ctx,
        interfaceName,
        oldIp,
        newIp,
        subnetMask);
```

```csharp
await SwapIpWindowsAsync(
    interfaceName,
    oldIp,
    newIp,
    subnetMask,
    cancellationToken);
```

---

## 11. R10 — No boolean positional parameters

`configure(host, true, false)` is unreadable. Use a named field or an enum — and the field still
obeys R3 (`is` / `has`).

```go
type AddressMode int

const (
	AddressModeStaticValue AddressMode = iota
	AddressModeDhcp
)

func Configure(ctx context.Context, params ConfigureParams) error
```

```ts
configure({ host, isTlsEnabled: true, isPeerVerified: false });
```

```python
configure(host, is_tls_enabled=True, is_peer_verified=False)
```

---

## 12. R11 — Context / cancellation position

- Go: `ctx context.Context` is always the first parameter, never stored in a struct field.
- C#: `CancellationToken` is the **last** parameter by .NET convention — apply the language
  convention, not Go's, and be consistent within the codebase.
- Rust / Python / TS: pass the cancellation handle (`&Context`, `AbortSignal`) explicitly rather
  than reading a global.

---

## 13. R12 — Document returns

Multi-value returns must be unambiguous. If two returns share a type, name them (Go named results in
the doc comment, TS a named object, Python a `NamedTuple`, Rust a struct).

```go
// SwapIp applies params.NewIp to the named interface.
// It returns a wrapped *apperror.Error when the netsh command fails, nil on success.
func SwapIp(ctx context.Context, params SwapIpParams) error
```

---

## 14. R13–R20 — Line gaps and whitespace

These rules govern blank lines. No mainstream formatter enforces them, so they never conflict with
`gofmt`, `prettier`, `black`, `rustfmt`, `spotless`, or `dotnet format`.

### R13 — Blank line before `return` / `throw`

One blank line before every `return`, `throw`, `raise`, or early exit — **unless it is the only
statement in the block**. A single-statement `if`, `for`, `match`, or function body keeps its
`return` tight against the brace.

```go
// AFTER
func classify(params SwapIpParams) string {
	if params.NewIp == "" {
		return classificationEmpty
	}

	mode := detectMode(params)
	if mode == AddressModeDhcp {
		return classificationDhcp
	}

	return classificationStatic
}
```

`classificationEmpty` and `classificationDhcp` are the only statements in their blocks, so no blank
line precedes them. The final `return` follows other statements, so it gets one.

```ts
export function classify(params: SwapIpParams): string {
  if (!params.newIp) {
    return CLASSIFICATION_EMPTY;
  }

  const mode = detectMode(params);
  if (mode === AddressMode.Dhcp) {
    return CLASSIFICATION_DHCP;
  }

  return CLASSIFICATION_STATIC;
}
```

```python
def classify(params: SwapIpParams) -> str:
    if not params.new_ip:
        return CLASSIFICATION_EMPTY

    mode = detect_mode(params)
    if mode is AddressMode.DHCP:
        return CLASSIFICATION_DHCP

    return CLASSIFICATION_STATIC
```

Python equivalents of `throw`: `raise`. Rust: the `?` operator counts as an early exit only when it
stands on its own statement line preceded by other statements; an expression-position tail value
needs no blank line if it is the block's only statement.

```rust
pub fn classify(params: &SwapIpParams) -> Result<Classification, AppError> {
    if params.new_ip.is_empty() {
        return Ok(Classification::Empty);
    }

    let mode = detect_mode(params)?;

    Ok(Classification::from(mode))
}
```

```java
public String classify(SwapIpParams params) {
    if (params.newIp().isEmpty()) {
        return CLASSIFICATION_EMPTY;
    }

    AddressMode mode = detectMode(params);

    return mode == AddressMode.DHCP ? CLASSIFICATION_DHCP : CLASSIFICATION_STATIC;
}
```

```csharp
public string Classify(SwapIpParams parameters)
{
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(parameters.NewIp))
    {
        return ClassificationEmpty;
    }

    AddressMode mode = DetectMode(parameters);

    return mode == AddressMode.Dhcp ? ClassificationDhcp : ClassificationStatic;
}
```

### R14 — Blank line after a closing `}`

One blank line after a closing brace, **unless** the next line is another `}`, `else`, `case`, or
`catch`. Chained constructs stay chained; independent statements get separated.

```go
// WRONG
if err := validate(params); err != nil {
	return err
}
cmd := build(params)
```

```go
// RIGHT
if err := validate(params); err != nil {
	return err
}

cmd := build(params)
```

```go
// RIGHT — no blank line before `else`
if params.IsDryRun {
	logPlan(cmd)
} else {
	runPlan(cmd)
}
```

Python has no braces: the equivalent is one blank line after a dedent that ends a block, unless the
next line is `else`, `elif`, `except`, `finally`, or `case`.

### R15 — Never two blank lines in a row

Anywhere, in any language. This overrides PEP 8's two-blank-line convention between top-level
Python definitions: use exactly one.

### R16 — No padded braces

No blank line immediately after `{`, and none immediately before `}`. The same applies to a Python
block's first and last lines.

```go
// WRONG
func run() error {

	return doWork()

}
```

```go
// RIGHT
func run() error {
	return doWork()
}
```

### R17 — One blank line between top-level declarations

Functions, classes, types, interfaces, and exported constants are separated by exactly one blank
line. Grouped `const`/`var` blocks count as one declaration.

### R18 — Import grouping

Exactly one blank line between groups, in this order, with no mixing:

1. Standard library
2. Third-party
3. First-party absolute
4. First-party relative

```go
import (
	"context"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/spf13/cobra"

	"example.com/service/internal/apperror"

	"./netsh"
)
```

```ts
import { readFile } from "node:fs/promises";

import { z } from "zod";

import { AppError } from "@/lib/app-error";

import { netshExecutor } from "./netsh";
```

```python
import os
from contextlib import suppress

import httpx

from service.apperror import AppError

from .netsh import netsh_executor
```

Rust groups as `std` / external crates / `crate::` / `self::`+`super::`. Java groups as `java.*` and
`javax.*` / third-party / first-party. C# groups as `System.*` / third-party / first-party.

### R19 — File hygiene

Every file ends with exactly one trailing newline. No trailing whitespace on any line, including
otherwise-blank lines inside blocks.

### R20 — No section separators inside a function

Blank lines inside a function exist only because R13 or R14 requires them. If you want a blank line
to mark "this next part does something else", the function is doing more than one thing — extract
the part into its own function instead of adding whitespace. Suggestion-level, but a repeated
pattern of it should be raised as a design finding.

## 15. R21 — No per-field comments inside structs

Fields carry no comment by default. A well-named field with an explicit type documents itself, and a
comment on every field is noise that hides the one field that actually needed explaining.

A field comment is allowed **only** when the meaning cannot be inferred from name and type:

- units or scale (`TimeoutMs`, `SizeBytes` where the name cannot carry it)
- invariants or valid ranges the type does not express
- a non-obvious default applied elsewhere
- a wire-contract quirk kept for backward compatibility

Doc comments on the **type itself** stay and are encouraged.

```go
// WRONG — every field commented, all of them obvious
type SwapIpParams struct {
	// InterfaceName is the OS interface name.
	InterfaceName string `json:"InterfaceName"`
	// NewIp is the static address to assign.
	NewIp string `json:"NewIp"`
	// IsDryRun reports whether the command is logged instead of executed.
	IsDryRun bool `json:"IsDryRun"`
}
```

```go
// RIGHT — type documented, fields speak for themselves, one earned comment
// SwapIpParams describes a single static-Ip reassignment on one network interface.
// Empty InterfaceName and SubnetMask fall back to the package defaults.
type SwapIpParams struct {
	InterfaceName string `json:"InterfaceName"`
	// OldIp is advisory only: it is recorded in error context, never asserted.
	OldIp      string `json:"OldIp"`
	NewIp      string `json:"NewIp"`
	SubnetMask string `json:"SubnetMask"`
	IsDryRun   bool   `json:"IsDryRun"`
}
```

The same applies to TypeScript interfaces, Python dataclasses and Pydantic models, Rust structs,
Java records, and C# records.

```ts
/** A single static-Ip reassignment on one network interface. */
interface SwapIpParams {
  interfaceName: string;
  /** Advisory only: recorded in error context, never asserted. */
  oldIp: string;
  newIp: string;
  subnetMask: string;
  isDryRun: boolean;
}
```

## 16. Worked example — the reviewed snippet

### Input

```go
func swapIPWindows(ctx context.Context, interfaceName string, newIP string) error {
	if interfaceName == "" {
		interfaceName = "Ethernet"
	}
	cmd := netshExecutor(ctx, "netsh", "interface", "ip", "set", "address", "name="+interfaceName, "static", newIP, "255.255.255.0")
	if err := cmd.Run(); err != nil {
		return apperror.Wrap(err, "swapIPWindows", map[string]any{"interface": interfaceName})
	}
	return nil
}

func swapIP(ctx context.Context, interfaceName, oldIP, newIP string) error {
	return swapIPWindows(ctx, interfaceName, newIP)
}
```

### Findings

| Rule | Location        | Finding                                                                                                              |
| ---- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| R1   | whole file      | `swapIPWindows`, `newIP`, `oldIP`, `swapIP` use all-caps `IP`. Rename to `swapIpWindows`, `newIp`, `oldIp`, `SwapIp`.    |
| R2   | error context   | Context key `"interface"` is lowercase; serialization keys must be Pascal case (`"InterfaceName"`).                      |
| R5   | `swapIp`        | `interfaceName, oldIp, newIp string` — three adjacent same-typed params; trivially swappable. Group into `SwapIpParams`. |
| R6   | `swapIp`        | `oldIp` is accepted and never used or forwarded. Defect.                                                                 |
| R8   | `swapIpWindows` | `"Ethernet"`, `"255.255.255.0"`, `"netsh"`, `"static"` are magic literals.                                               |
| R9   | `swapIpWindows` | 130-char, 10-argument call on one line. Split, or build an args slice.                                                   |
| R12  | both            | No doc comment on the error contract.                                                                                    |
| R13  | `swapIpWindows` | Final `return nil` follows other statements with no blank line before it.                                                |
| R14  | `swapIpWindows` | No blank line after the closing `}` of the `if interfaceName == ""` block or the `cmd.Run()` block.                      |

### Output

```go
const (
	defaultInterfaceName = "Ethernet"
	defaultSubnetMask    = "255.255.255.0"
	netshBinary          = "netsh"
	addressModeStatic    = "static"
)

// SwapIpParams describes a single static-Ip reassignment on one network interface.
// Empty InterfaceName and SubnetMask fall back to the package defaults.
type SwapIpParams struct {
	InterfaceName string `json:"InterfaceName"`
	// OldIp is advisory only: it is recorded in error context, never asserted.
	OldIp      string `json:"OldIp"`
	NewIp      string `json:"NewIp"`
	SubnetMask string `json:"SubnetMask"`
	IsDryRun   bool   `json:"IsDryRun"`
}

func (p SwapIpParams) withDefaults() SwapIpParams {
	if p.InterfaceName == "" {
		p.InterfaceName = defaultInterfaceName
	}

	if p.SubnetMask == "" {
		p.SubnetMask = defaultSubnetMask
	}

	return p
}

// swapIpWindows assigns params.NewIp to params.InterfaceName via netsh.
// It returns a wrapped error when the netsh command fails, nil on success.
func swapIpWindows(ctx context.Context, params SwapIpParams) error {
	params = params.withDefaults()

	args := []string{
		"interface",
		"ip",
		"set",
		"address",
		"name=" + params.InterfaceName,
		addressModeStatic,
		params.NewIp,
		params.SubnetMask,
	}

	cmd := netshExecutor(ctx, netshBinary, args...)
	if err := cmd.Run(); err != nil {
		return apperror.Wrap(err, "swapIpWindows", map[string]any{
			"InterfaceName": params.InterfaceName,
			"OldIp":         params.OldIp,
			"NewIp":         params.NewIp,
		})
	}

	return nil
}

// SwapIp dispatches a static-Ip swap to the platform-specific implementation.
// It returns a wrapped error on failure, nil on success.
func SwapIp(ctx context.Context, params SwapIpParams) error {
	return swapIpWindows(ctx, params)
}
```

`SwapIp`'s body is a single statement, so its `return` keeps no blank line before it (R13).
`OldIp` is now carried through to the error context instead of being silently discarded — if the
intent was a precondition check, add it explicitly rather than leaving a dead parameter.

## 18. Linter specification — how the AI verifies its own output

This section is the machine-checkable form of the guide. After rewriting code, walk it top to
bottom and emit one pass/fail line per rule. Rules marked auto-fixable must be applied silently in
the rewrite; the rest are reported.

### Rule index

| R6   | Every param appears in the body, or is prefixed `_` with a trailing reason comment               | Must fix   | No           |
| R7   | No call whose error/exception result is discarded; every propagation adds operation context      | Must fix   | No           |

| R18  | Import block groups are ordered stdlib → third-party → first-party abs → relative, one blank line apart | Must fix | Yes    |
| R19  | File ends with exactly one `\n`; no line matches `[ \t]+$`                                       | Must fix   | Yes          |
| R20  | No blank line inside a function that is not required by R13 or R14                               | Suggestion | No           |
| R21  | No comment attached to a struct field unless it states units, invariants, defaults, or wire quirks | Must fix | No           |

### Self-verification procedure

1. Apply every auto-fixable rule to the rewritten code.
2. Re-read the rewritten code as if it were new input and walk R1 → R21 in order.
3. Emit `R{n}: pass` or `R{n}: fail — <location>` for each rule. A `fail` means go back to step 1.
4. Only after every must-fix rule passes, print the rewritten code.

### Findings

- R1 (must fix) — `swapIPWindows`: all-caps acronym; rename to `swapIpWindows`, `newIP` → `newIp`.
- R5 (must fix) — `swapIp`: three adjacent `string` parameters; group into `SwapIpParams`.
- R6 (must fix) — `swapIp`: `oldIp` accepted but never used.
- R9 (must fix) — `swapIpWindows`: 130-char, 10-argument call to `netshExecutor`.
- R13 (must fix) — `swapIpWindows`: no blank line before the final `return nil`.
- R21 (must fix) — `SwapIpParams`: every field commented; keep only the `OldIp` note.

### Self-verification
