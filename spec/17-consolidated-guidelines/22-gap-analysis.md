# Consolidated Guidelines — Gap Analysis Report

**Version:** 13.1.0
**Updated:** 2026-05-07
**Scope:** All 23 consolidated guideline files vs source spec folders + spec/19 readiness sweep at v5.41.0
**Previous:** v13.0.0 (2026-04-22) — source-folder coverage map sweep

## v13.1.0 Changes — Hardening Patch I + Audit-12 closure

At v5.41.0 the spec/19 non-backup surface advanced to **98 / 100** (audit `12-`). Hardening Patch I closed the three gaps surfaced by the v5.39.0 readiness sweep:

- **G1** — `03-tasks` added to `linter-scripts/spec-folder-refs.allowlist` (sibling-repo doc-only ref).
- **G2** — broken cross-link in `02-spec/19/26-inherited-rules.md` corrected (`../03-error-manage/`).
- **G3** — MWS error catalogue grew 84 → 89 codes (`WORKER-403-01/02`, `WORKER-503-01/02`, `MAIN-900-01`); R4 widened to recognise §4 overflow range `21200-21299`; new `check-mws-error-codes.unallocated.txt` codifies 3 forbidden-future codes (`WORKER-940-05`, `WORKER-940-10`, `MAIN-830-04`).

All 14/14 `lint-ci.sh` steps green; 4/4 ancillary checks green. Patches A–D (audit-10) and Patch D-closure (v5.39.0) verified durable in audit `13-`.

Overall implementability score: **98.0/100** (up from 97.6). Handoff-weighted: **99.5/100** (up from 99.0). The remaining 0.5 point splits between the documented backup-snapshot-restore deferral (intentional, gated by `MAIN-900-01 SpecContradiction` safe-fail) and uncommitted baseline diagram PNGs.

## v13.0.0 Changes — Source-Folder Coverage Sweep (preserved below)

## v13.0.0 Changes — Source-Folder Coverage Sweep

The five highest-impact consolidated files received explicit **Source-Folder Coverage Maps** in their headers, plus added sections covering previously-undocumented source files. This closes the AI-blindness gap reported by the user: an AI handed any one of these files now knows precisely which source files it summarizes and where the gaps (if any) remain.

| File | Coverage Map | New Sections Added | New Lines |
|------|--------------|--------------------|-----------|
| `05-coding-guidelines.md` | ✅ Maps all 16 subfolders | §§22–33 (TS, Go, PHP, Rust, AI-opt, CI/CD-int, C#, file/folder, PowerShell, research, security, app-specific) | ~330 |
| `06-error-management.md` | ✅ Maps all 13 subfolders | §§18–26 (retros, verification, debugging, notification colors, error modal, envelope, apperror, logging, error code registry) | ~300 |
| `18-cicd-pipeline-workflows.md` | ✅ Maps 13 root specs + 3 subfolders + diagrams | Reusable CI Guards, Browser Ext Deploy, Go Binary Deploy, RCA, vuln scan detail, install scripts detail, code signing detail, terminal output, icon branding, env setup, release body, diagrams | ~150 |
| `20-self-update-app-update.md` | ✅ Maps all 25 source files | Console-safe handoff, repo path sync, version verification, last-release detection, install script probe, update check mechanism, release-pinned installer | ~180 |
| `21-database-conventions.md` | ✅ Maps 7 source files + cross-cutting + new rules | §18 Mandatory Free-Text Columns (Rules 10/11/12) with linter integration | ~85 |

---

## Executive Summary

All five critical handoff files now publish explicit Source-Folder Coverage Maps and language/subfolder sections. Overall implementability score: **97.6/100** (up from 96.2). Handoff-weighted: **99.0/100** (up from 98.0). The remaining 1.0 point is reserved for placeholder/reference-only sections that intentionally defer to source specs.

## Score Interpretation

| Range | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 90–100 | AI can implement with zero human intervention |
| 80–89 | AI can implement with minimal clarification |
| 60–79 | AI needs to read source specs for some topics |
| 40–59 | Significant gaps — source specs required |
