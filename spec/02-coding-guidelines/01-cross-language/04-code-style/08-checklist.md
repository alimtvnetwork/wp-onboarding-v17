## Checklist Summary (Copy for PRs)

```
[ ] No single-line `if (...) return;` — always use braces
[ ] No nested `if` — ZERO TOLERANCE — flatten with early returns or combined conditions
[ ] No inline multi-part `if` (2+ operators) — extract to named variable or method
[ ] Blank line before `return` or `throw` when preceded by other statements
[ ] Blank line after closing `}` when followed by more code
[ ] Functions max 15 lines — extract helpers for longer logic
[ ] Error handling lines exempt from 15-line count (guards, wrapping, context)
[ ] No deeply nested control flow — extract loop/condition bodies to helpers
[ ] No leading backslash on `Throwable` or other global types in catch/type hints
[ ] Functions/calls with >2 args — one arg per line with trailing comma (signatures AND calls)
[ ] PHP arrays with >2 items — each item on its own line with trailing comma
[ ] Blank line before control structures (`if`/`for`/`foreach`/`while`) when preceded by statements
[ ] Method chaining — each `.Method()` on its own line (>2 calls)
[ ] apperror.Wrap/New with 2+ args — always multi-line, each arg on its own line
[ ] Nested apperror.Fail[T](Wrap(...)) — always expanded to multi-line
[ ] No commented-out or dead code — delete it, use version control
[ ] Space after `//` in all line comments
