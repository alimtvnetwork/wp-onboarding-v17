- **Per-release:** Before any deployment, verify Axios version in lock file
- **On alert:** If a new CVE is published for Axios, immediately review

### 5.2 Sources to Monitor

| Source | URL |
|--------|-----|
| Axios GitHub Releases | `https://github.com/axios/axios/releases` |
| npm Advisory Database | `https://www.npmjs.com/advisories` |
| CVE Database | `https://cve.mitre.org/` |
| Snyk Vulnerability DB | `https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:axios` |

### 5.3 Response Procedure

If a new vulnerability is discovered:

1. Determine if current approved versions are affected
2. If affected — identify the nearest safe version
3. Update this spec with new blocked/approved versions
4. Notify all team members
5. Deploy patched version within 24 hours for production

## 6. Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I use Axios 1.14.2 or later?

**A:** Not without going through the [Version Upgrade Procedure](./02-implementation-rules.md#5-version-upgrade-procedure). Any version not listed as approved in `01-index.md` is blocked by default.

### Q: What if `npm audit` recommends upgrading Axios?

**A:** Do NOT auto-fix. Run `npm audit --dry-run` and review. If Axios is flagged, consult this spec and the security lead before taking action.

### Q: Can I use a different HTTP client instead?

**A:** That is outside the scope of this spec. If considering alternatives (e.g., `fetch`, `ky`, `got`), create a separate evaluation spec.
