## Structure

- Feature specs, behavioral rules, and acceptance criteria go directly in this folder.
- Cross-cutting concerns (coding guidelines, language standards) remain in their existing `spec/` subfolders.

## Known Pitfalls and Prevention

When a recurring mistake is identified and fixed, the relevant spec in this folder must be updated with:

1. **Corrected behavior** — what the spec now says.
2. **Explicit constraints** — rules that prevent the old mistake.
3. **Failure modes** — how to detect if the mistake recurs.
4. **Acceptance criteria** — testable conditions for regression detection.
5. **Reference** — a link to the issue write-up under `../02-app-issues/`.

See the [Issue Write-Up Process](../02-app-issues/README.md) for the mandatory post-fix workflow.
