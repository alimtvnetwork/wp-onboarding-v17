## 1. Success Probability by Module Complexity Tier

### Tier 1: Simple Modules (96% success probability)

| Module | Confidence | Assumptions |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Database Schema (SQLite/GORM) | 96% | PascalCase convention documented; split DB rules clear |
| Error Codes/Constants | 98% | SSOT in shared-constants + envelope.schema.json |
| Config Seeding (JSON → SQLite) | 96% | Golden rule well-documented |
| Site/Plugin CRUD | 96% | Standard REST; AES encryption specified |
| QUpload settings.json (S-049) | 95% | Simple config file; defaults documented |
| Log rotation-status endpoint (S-050) | 94% | GET endpoint returning existing data |

### Tier 2: Medium Modules (90% success probability)

| Module | Confidence | Assumptions |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Publish Pipeline (5-stage) | 91% | Well-documented with 4 recovery strategies |
| File Watcher (fsnotify) | 89% | Hybrid watcher mode documented |
| Frontend API Client | 93% | Modular split documented |
| Cloud Storage CRUD (React) | 92% | Full dashboard already built |
| Verbose -check mode (S-051) | 90% | Extends existing mode-check.ps1 |
| Chunk reassembly validation (S-048) | 88% | Go backend — clear scope |
| Auto-invalidate cached ZIP (S-052) | 87% | Hash-based; well-scoped |
| Backup History Visualization (S-047) | 89% | Cloud Storage dashboard exists |
| Google Drive rotation (S-046) | 86% | Phase 5F; provider API documented |

### Tier 3: Complex / Agentic Workflows (83% success probability)

| Module | Confidence | Assumptions |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Licensing Admin Dashboard (S-053) | 76% | No spec written — only suggestion-level |
| Publish Analytics Dashboard (S-054) | 78% | No spec written — only suggestion-level |
| User Management wiring (H-3) | 82% | PHP+Go+React scaffolded; needs route/sidebar |
| Cross-stack error chain (PHP→Go→React) | 85% | Envelope v1.0.0 aligned; edge cases possible |

### Tier 4: End-to-End Workflows (79% success probability)

| Module | Confidence | Assumptions |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Full Publish → Verify → Rollback cycle | 81% | Multiple services coordinate |
| Deployment verification (all remote sites) | 70% | Blocked on user PowerShell action |
| Git Backup Full Cycle (backup→schedule→restore) | 75% | Complex provider-specific behavior |

## 2. Failure Map

### 2.1 Where Failures Are Likely

| Area | Risk Level | Why | Symptoms |
|------|-----------|-----|----------|
| **Deployment to remote sites** | 🔴 High | User must run PowerShell; version drift risk | EnvelopeBuilder crashes, missing preflight |
| **Licensing Dashboard (S-053)** | 🟡 Medium-High | No spec — AI would need to invent design | Wrong UX, missing fields, no acceptance criteria |
| **Publish Analytics (S-054)** | 🟡 Medium-High | No spec — ambiguous scope | Over/under-engineered dashboard |
| **User Management wiring** | 🟡 Medium | Scaffolded but not routed; unclear priority | Partially integrated, dead routes |
| **WordPress API variability** | 🟡 Medium | Different WP versions, hosting configs | 401/403, unexpected response formats |
| **Cross-platform paths** | 🟢 Low | Windows vs Linux separators | Files not found |
| **SQLite concurrency** | 🟢 Low | Bulk publish concurrent writes | "database is locked" |

### 2.2 Cross-File Inconsistencies Found (2026-04-01)

| Issue | Location | Severity | Fix |
|-------|----------|----------|-----|
| `.ai-memory/README.md` says "0 open suggestions, 18 completed" | `.ai-memory/README.md` line 84-89 | Medium | Update to 9 open, 57 completed |
| `pending-tasks.md` lists items already completed in `plan.md` (Phase F, G done) | `pending-tasks.md` vs `plan.md` | Medium | Reconcile — pending-tasks is stale |
| `plan/active.md` says "H-3 in progress" but plan.md says "H-3 Complete" | `plan/active.md` vs `plan.md` | Low | Sync status |
| `02-project-context.md` says "companion WP Plugin v1.36.1" — likely outdated | `02-project-context.md` line 29 | Low | Verify current version |
| `01-workflow.md` spec folder list uses old numbering (08→17) | `01-workflow.md` lines 57-68 | Low | Update to match new `02-spec/` structure |

### 2.3 Ambiguity Areas

| Area | What's Ambiguous | Impact |
|------|------------------|--------|
| Licensing Dashboard | No spec, no wireframe, no acceptance criteria | Cannot implement safely |
| Publish Analytics | No spec, scope undefined | Risk of rework |
| User Management priority | Scaffolded but not in any active phase | Unknown when to finish |

---

## 3. Corrective Actions (Prioritized)

| # | Fix | Where | Expected Gain |
|---|-----|-------|--------------|
| 1 | **Deploy v2.30.0+ to all remote sites** | User action (PowerShell) | +5% — unblocks all deployment verifications |
| 2 | **Write spec for Licensing Dashboard** before S-053 | New spec file under `02-spec/` | +3% — prevents wasted cycles |
| 3 | **Write spec for Publish Analytics** before S-054 | New spec file under `02-spec/` | +3% — defines scope |
| 4 | **Reconcile stale memory files** — pending-tasks.md, README.md counts | Multiple `.ai-memory/` files | +2% — accurate handoff |
| 5 | **Finish User Management wiring** or explicitly defer | `plan/active.md` | +1% — removes ambiguity |
| 6 | **Update `02-project-context.md`** version numbers | `.ai-memory/memory/02-project-context.md` | +1% — accurate state |

## 4. Readiness Decision

### ✅ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION — with caveats

**Ready to implement now (well-specified, 9 open suggestions):**

| ID | Task | Spec Quality |
|----|------|-------------|
| S-046 | Google Drive rotation (Phase 5F) | Good — provider API documented |
| S-047 | Backup History Visualization | Good — dashboard exists |
| S-048 | Chunk reassembly validation | Good — clear Go backend scope |
| S-049 | QUpload settings.json | Good — simple config file |
| S-050 | /logs/rotation-status endpoint | Good — GET endpoint |
| S-051 | Verbose -check mode | Good — extends existing script |
| S-052 | Auto-invalidate cached ZIP | Good — hash-based, scoped |

**Not ready (needs spec work first):**
- S-053: Licensing Dashboard — no spec
- S-054: Publish Analytics — no spec

**Blocked (needs user action):**
- Phase A: Deployment to remote sites
- I-4: Redeploy for plugin_slug fix (v2.30.0)

**Risk Mitigation for New AI:**
1. Always test WordPress API calls against staging first
2. Use `apperror.Wrap()` — never `fmt.Errorf`
3. Follow envelope schema for all API responses
4. Follow post-fix issue writeup workflow for every bug fix
5. Use `DateHelper` — never raw `date()`/`gmdate()`
6. Use `ResponseKeyType` — never raw string keys
7. PHP: `catch(Throwable)` — never `catch(Exception)`
8. PHP: namespace before ABSPATH guard — never reversed
9. Read specs in order documented in `spec/readme.md`
10. Don't modify `.release/` folder
