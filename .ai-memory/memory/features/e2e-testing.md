## Overview

The project includes a comprehensive Go-based end-to-end (E2E) testing suite that validates the complete plugin lifecycle against **real WordPress sites**. Tests follow the Split Database architecture for data isolation.

## Architecture

### Backend (`backend/internal/services/e2e/`)

- **types.go**: TestSuite, TestCase, TestRun, TestResult types
- **service.go**: Test runner with async execution
- Database tables: `test_suites`, `test_cases`, `test_runs`, `test_results`

### Frontend (`src/pages/Tests.tsx`)

- **Unified header**: App title "WP Plugin Publish" with breadcrumb-style section indicator (e.g., "/ E2E Tests")
- **Tabbed categories**: Plugin CRUD, Site Connections, Sync Operations, Publish Flow
- **Card-based test cases**: Each test displayed as a selectable card with checkbox, ID badge, description, and step count
- **Select all per category**: Checkbox to toggle all tests in a category
- Real-time run progress via WebSocket
- Run history with expandable results
- Error detail modal integration
