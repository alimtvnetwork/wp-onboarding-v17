# Backend Logging Requirements

## File-Based Logging

All backend logs are written to persistent files in `data/errors/`:
- `log.txt` - All log entries (INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL)
- `error.log.txt` - Error and fatal logs only

## API Endpoint

A `/api/v1/errors/bundle` endpoint creates and serves a ZIP bundle containing both log files plus a manifest.json with metadata for easy sharing and support.

## External API Failure Logging

When an external API call fails (especially WordPress REST API calls), logs MUST include:
1. The fully resolved request URL
2. The HTTP method used  
3. The response status code
4. The full response body (truncated to 8KB if larger)
5. The endpoint path (e.g., `/wp/v2/plugins`, `/riseup-asia-uploader/v1/upload`)
6. Stack trace for debugging (when available)

**CRITICAL**: The human-readable error string MUST include at least `METHOD + endpoint` (not only in structured details), e.g.
`upload plugin via RiseupAsia Uploader (POST /riseup-asia-uploader/v1/upload): status 500`.

This requirement applies to all WordPress client methods including activation, upload, and mutation token requests.

**CRITICAL**: Every WordPress API error MUST use the `APIError` struct which includes:
- `Operation`: What action was being performed
- `Method`: HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- `Endpoint`: The REST API endpoint path
- `URL`: The fully resolved URL
- `StatusCode`: HTTP response status
- `ResponseBody`: Server response (truncated to 8KB)
- `StackTrace`: Call stack at error time (when captured)

**Never** return a plain `fmt.Errorf()` for WordPress API failures—always use `APIError` so the frontend can display full diagnostic context.

## Real Plugin Upload

The publish service uses the companion plugin (`onboard-plugin/v1`) for real plugin uploads when available. The `UploadPluginZip` method:
1. Requests a mutation token for 'upload' action
2. POSTs the ZIP as multipart/form-data
3. Logs all request/response details for diagnostics

If the companion plugin is not installed, upload is simulated with a warning log.

## Mandatory Logging Standards

Every backend operation MUST include detailed inner logs that capture:

### 1. Connection Operations
- **WordPress Connection**: Log site URL, username (not password), connection initiation
- **Database Operations**: Log table name, operation type, affected rows
- **External API calls**: Log full resolved URL, method, request size, response status, and response body snippet (first ~8KB) on non-2xx

### 2. File Operations
- **ZIP Creation**: Log source path, output path, file count, ZIP size in bytes
- **File Upload**: Log file path, destination URL, file size
- **File Extraction**: Log source archive, destination path, extracted count

### 3. Stage-by-Stage Logging
Every multi-stage operation (publish, sync, backup) MUST log:
```
[TIMESTAMP] [LEVEL] [STEP] Message with context
```

Include structured details in log entries:
```go
s.broadcastDetailedLog(pluginID, siteID, "info", "package", "Creating ZIP", map[string]interface{}{
    "pluginPath": plug.Path,
    "zipPath":    zipPath,
    "fileCount":  fileCount,
    "zipSize":    info.Size(),
})
```

### 4. Error Context
All errors MUST include:
- The step/stage where error occurred
- Full error message
- Relevant context (IDs, paths, URLs)
- Stack trace for unexpected errors

## Frontend Log Display

The frontend MUST:
1. Display logs in a dedicated tab (not inline to avoid scroll issues)
2. Use `LogViewer` component with proper height constraints
3. Show log count in tab badge
4. Support copy-to-clipboard for all logs

## On-disk Log Files (Troubleshooting Bundles)

The backend MUST maintain persistent local log files under `backend/data/errors/`:
- `log.txt` - all backend logs
- `error.log.txt` - errors/fatals only

These files are used as the first-line artifact when investigating publish/sync/connection failures.

## Timestamp Format Consistency

All backend logs MUST use a consistent, human-readable UTC format:
```
[vX.X.X YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] [package] Message key=value [LEVEL] [file/path:line]
```

Example:
```
[v1.19.4 2026-02-05 00:05:40] [publish] Building package... mode=full [INFO] [internal/services/publish/service.go:186]
```

### Log Format Requirements
- Version prefix from app version info
- Package name extracted from Go function path
- Full relative file paths (from `internal/` or `pkg/`) with line numbers
- For ERROR and FATAL levels: automatic stack trace appended

## ZIP File Naming

ZIP files for plugin uploads MUST use slug-based naming:
- Format: `plugin-name.zip` (lowercase, hyphens, no spaces or timestamps)
- Example: `category-generator.zip` NOT `Category Generator-1770249940.zip`

## Absolute Path Requirements

**All paths in logs and API calls MUST be absolute.**

- Never log relative paths like `.temp\plugin.zip`
- Use `pathutil.ToAbsolute()` to resolve paths before logging
- Windows paths exceeding 260 characters automatically get `\\?\` prefix
- See: `.ai-memory/memory/architecture/backend/path-management.md`

## Pre-Upload Status Check

Before uploading files to WordPress:

1. Call the status endpoint (`/riseup-asia-uploader/v1/status`)
2. Verify response is 200 OK
3. Log the status check result
4. Only then proceed with upload

This prevents upload failures due to unreachable/misconfigured endpoints.

## ZIP Structure Logging

During the package stage, the backend MUST log the internal structure of the created ZIP file:
- List all files/folders inside the ZIP with their sizes
- Show the first 20 entries in detailed debug logs
- Include the full list in the structured `zipStructure` detail field
- Format: `plugin-folder/file.php (1234 bytes)`

This helps diagnose issues where the ZIP structure (root folder presence, file paths) causes upload failures.

## Keep ZIP Files Setting

A user-configurable "Keep ZIP Files" setting allows preserving ZIP files in the temp folder after publish operations:
- Default: false (ZIP files are deleted after upload)
- When enabled: ZIP files remain in `.temp/` for debugging
- Setting is stored in localStorage (`wppp_keep_zip_files`)
- Overridable per-publish in the Publish Progress Dialog settings tab

## Naming Conventions

Use "RiseupAsia" (one word, lowercase "up") consistently throughout the codebase:
- ✅ `RiseupAsia Uploader`
- ❌ `Rise Up Uploader`

## Structured Error Requirements

The following patterns are **PROHIBITED** in Go backend code:

| Pattern | Replacement |
|---------|-------------|
| `fmt.Errorf()` for wrapped errors | `apperror.Wrap(err, code, message)` |
| `errors.New()` for new errors | `apperror.New(code, message)` |
| Plain error strings in WordPress | `APIError{}` struct |

### Error Code Categories

- `E1xxx` - Configuration errors
- `E2xxx` - Database errors
- `E3xxx` - WordPress API errors
- `E4xxx` - File system errors
- `E5xxx` - Sync errors
- `E6xxx` - Backup errors
- `E7xxx` - Git errors
- `E8xxx` - Build errors
- `E9xxx` - General errors

### Files Updated (Phase 1-3)

All files in these packages have been refactored to use `apperror`:
- `backend/internal/wordpress/` - client.go, uploader.go
- `backend/internal/services/backup/` - service.go
- `backend/internal/database/` - database.go, migrations.go
- `backend/internal/database/splitdb/` - manager.go

The `apperror.Wrap()` function automatically captures:
- Stack trace
- File/line/function location
- Context key-value pairs
