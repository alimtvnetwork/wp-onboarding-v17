# Active Development Plan

> **Updated:** 2026-03-16

---

## Current Focus Areas

- **PowerShell Automation:** CLI suite complete with `-check`, `-am` preflight, full site targeting. Ready for deployment verification.
- **QUpload Stability:** EnvelopeBuilder crash fix applied. Self-update resilience via `class_exists()` fallback. Log rotation confirmed working.
- **Cloud Storage Integration:** Frontend complete (3 providers + dashboard + publish integration). Backend Go pipeline integration pending.
- **Code Quality & Standards:** Ongoing enforcement of formatting rules and code consistency.
- **Issue Documentation:** Every fix requires a write-up under `/02-spec/02-app-issues/` per the post-fix workflow.
