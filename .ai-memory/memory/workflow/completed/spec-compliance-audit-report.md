# Spec Directory — Coding Standards Compliance Report

**Generated:** 2026-02-17  
**Scope:** All files under `02-spec/`  
**Standards:** v3.1.0 (PHP 8.2+, Go, TypeScript)

---

## 1. Audit Summary

| Audit Area | Files Scanned | Violations Found | Fixed | Remaining |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Nested `if` blocks (flat control flow) | All PHP blocks in `02-spec/` | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Double negatives (`!isNot…`, `!isNon…`) | All languages in `02-spec/` | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| Missing `is`/`has` boolean prefixes | All languages in `02-spec/` | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| Raw negation of filesystem functions | All PHP blocks in `02-spec/` | 3 | 3 | 0 |
| **Totals** | — | **5** | **5** | **0** |

---

## 2. Violations Fixed

### 2.1 Double Negatives

| File | Line | Before | After |
|---|---|---|---|
| `02-spec/10-wp-plugin-publish/01-backend/16-split-db-architecture.md` | ~809 | `projectExists := !os.IsNotExist(statErr(projectDir))` | `_, err := os.Stat(projectDir)` + `isProjectExists := err == nil` |

**Additional cleanup:** Removed unused `statErr()` helper function.

### 2.2 Missing `is`/`has` Boolean Prefixes

| File | Line | Before | After |
|---|---|---|---|
| `02-spec/06-php-standards/readme.md` | ~301 | `private $initialized = false` | `private bool $isInitialized = false` |

**Additional cleanup:** Added missing `bool` type hint per PHP 8.2+ standards.

### 2.3 Raw Negation of Global Filesystem Functions

| File | Line | Before | After |
|---|---|---|---|
| `02-spec/09-wordpress-plugin-development/07-error-handling.md` | ~652 | `!is_writable($dir)` | `PathHelper::isDirReadonly($dir)` |
| `02-spec/10-wp-plugin-publish/01-backend/06-file-watcher.md` | ~101 | `!file_exists($path)` | `PathHelper::isFileMissing($path)` |
| `02-spec/09-wordpress-plugin-development/08-compatibility.md` | ~155 | `!is_dir($path)` | `PathHelper::isDirMissing($path)` |

**Additional cleanup:** Added `use RiseupAsia\Helpers\PathHelper` import where missing.

## 3. Confirmed Non-Violations

### 3.1 Intentional ❌ FORBIDDEN Examples (Preserved)

Per the [documentation-forbidden-examples-strategy](../../memory/workflow/documentation-forbidden-examples-strategy), the following files contain raw negations **strictly inside ❌ FORBIDDEN blocks** as anti-pattern documentation:

- `02-spec/03-coding-guidelines/no-negatives.md` — reference tables and forbidden examples
- `02-spec/06-php-standards/forbidden-patterns.md` — forbidden pattern catalog
- `02-spec/06-php-standards/readme.md` — guard method replacement tables
- `02-spec/09-wordpress-plugin-development/11-coding-guidelines.md` — forbidden vs required tables

### 3.2 Idiomatic Patterns (Acceptable)

| File | Pattern | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `02-spec/07-…/01-initialization-patterns.md` | `!@mkdir(…) && !is_dir(…)` | Idiomatic mkdir race-condition guard inside `ensureDirectory()` |
| `02-spec/07-…/03-database-patterns.md` | Same pattern | Same idiomatic mkdir guard |
| `02-spec/07-…/02-logging-standards.md` | `file_exists($logPath)` (positive) | No negation — compliant |

---

## 4. Standards Verified (Zero Violations Found)

| Standard | Description |
|---|---|
| Flat control flow | No nested `if` blocks outside ❌ FORBIDDEN examples |
| Blank line before `return`/`throw` | All multi-statement blocks compliant |
| Multi-line signatures (>2 params) | All signatures compliant |
| Native PHP over trivial wrappers | No `isFalsy`/`isTruthy`/`isEmpty` usage found |

---

## 5. Conclusion

All `02-spec/` files are now **fully compliant** with coding standards v3.1.0. Five violations were identified and corrected across boolean naming, double negatives, and raw filesystem negations. All intentional anti-pattern examples in ❌ FORBIDDEN blocks were verified and preserved per documentation strategy.
