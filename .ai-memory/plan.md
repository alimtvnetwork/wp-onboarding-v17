- D-2: Backup History Visualization (timeline UI in Cloud Storage dashboard)

### ✅ Phase E: Git Backup Strategy (6 sub-phases)

- Analytics tab with distribution charts, creation timeline, expiration alerts
- Batch operations with confirmation dialogs and CSV export

### ✅ S-046: Google Drive Folder Rotation
- Go endpoint/operation enums, WP client, handlers, service proxy

## Active Issues

### Phase A: Deployment & Verification (🔴 Blocked — needs user)

| # | Task | Priority | Dependencies | Status |
|---|------|----------|------------|--------|
| A-1 | Deploy v2.17.0+ to all remote sites | 🔴 Critical | User runs `.\run.ps1 -uas` | Blocked |
| A-2 | Verify EnvelopeBuilder fallback fix | 🔴 Critical | A-1 | Blocked |
| A-3 | Verify preflight check works on remote | 🟡 Medium | A-1 | Blocked |

### 🔴 Phase J: Bootstrap Deploy Pipeline Rewrite (2026-03-22)

**Issue:** `02-spec/02-app-issues/40-bootstrap-deploy-pipeline-rewrite.md`

**Problem:** Go bootstrap deployer has fundamental architectural flaws: self-update causes 500 errors, ZIP created per-site, sequential processing, no cross-upload strategy, no pre-flight, no progress visualization, missing delegated error logs.

| # | Task | Priority | Dependencies | Status |
|---|------|----------|------------|--------|
| J-1 | Rewrite Go bootstrap — ZIP once, pass to all sites | 🔴 Critical | — | ✅ Done |
| J-2 | Implement cross-upload strategy (QUpload→Riseup, Riseup→QUpload) | 🔴 Critical | J-1 | ✅ Done |
| J-3 | Parallel site uploads with goroutines | 🟡 High | J-1, J-2 | ✅ Done |
| J-4 | Pre-flight endpoint check UI (like PowerShell -pas) | 🟡 High | — | ✅ Done |
| J-5 | Phased progress UI in deploy dialog (ZIP→Upload→Summary) | 🟡 High | J-1, J-3 | ✅ Done |
| J-6 | Delegated error logs in error modal (remote 500 response bodies) | 🟡 High | — | ✅ Done |
| J-7 | Retry limiting — max 1 attempt per plugin per site | 🟢 Medium | J-2 | ✅ Done |

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Deploy uses cross-upload: QUpload endpoint for Riseup Asia, Riseup Asia endpoint for QUpload
- ZIP created once, reused for all sites
- Sites uploaded in parallel
- Pre-flight shows version comparison before deploy
- 500 errors include remote response body in error modal delegated tab
- No infinite retry loops

### Phase I: Dashboard UX & Data Pipeline Fix (2026-03-22)

| # | Task | Priority | Dependencies | Status |
|---|------|----------|------------|--------|
| I-1 | Fix double-envelope wrapping (Health/Logs/Settings) | 🔴 Critical | — | ✅ Done |
| I-2 | Redesign SiteCard button layout | 🟡 High | — | ✅ Done |
| I-3 | PowerShell -d skip PHP propagation if no changes | 🟢 Medium | — | ✅ Done |
| I-4 | Redeploy to fix plugin_slug error (v2.30.0) | 🟡 High | User runs deploy | Blocked |

### ✅ Phase H: Future Features (All Complete)

| # | Task | Priority | Dependencies | Status |
|---|------|----------|------------|--------|
| H-2 | Publish analytics / history reporting (S-054) | 🟢 Low | — | ✅ Complete |
| H-3 | User Management implementation | 🟢 Low | `02-spec/16-user-management/` exists | ✅ Complete |
| S-046 | Google Drive folder rotation | 🟢 Low | — | ✅ Complete |
| S-053 | Licensing admin dashboard (Go backend) | 🟢 Low | H-1 | ✅ Complete |
