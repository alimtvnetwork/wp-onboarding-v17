- Keyboard shortcut: `F` key (when no input focused)

- Fullscreen hides the sidebar and expands the content area to fill the viewport
- Header remains visible with a minimize button to exit
- `Escape` key also exits fullscreen
- Implemented via React state (not browser Fullscreen API) for better control
