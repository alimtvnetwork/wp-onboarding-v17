# Generic Release Pipeline Specification

> **/goal** Master and enforce the architectural standards, specifications, and CI/CD validation rules for 16 Generic Release.
> **/learn** Read the sequentially ordered specification files in this directory, follow the actionable CI/CD checklist, and apply mandatory rules before generating code.

## 🎯 Actionable CI/CD & Agent Checklist

- [ ] `/goal` Read and understand all numbered specifications under `16-generic-release/`.
- [ ] `/learn` Adhere strictly to `.ai-memory/folder-structure.md` and `.ai-memory/strictly-avoid.md`.
- [ ] `/goal` Verify zero explicit `true` boolean evaluations and no mixed-polarity conditionals.
- [ ] `/learn` Run all local verification linters via `python 03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py`.

. **CRITICAL AI INSTRUCTION:** This `readme.md` file is the primary entry point for this directory. AI agents MUST read this file first before exploring other files in this folder.

## Purpose

This folder defines a **generic, reusable blueprint** for releasing
cross-compiled CLI binaries via CI/CD. It is tool-agnostic — replace
placeholder names with your actual binary name and repository URL.

Any AI or engineer reading these documents should be able to implement
a complete release pipeline from scratch without ambiguity.

## Release Pipeline Diagram

## Unified Architecture Diagram

See the Mermaid diagram: [`images/unified-architecture.mmd`](images/unified-architecture.mmd)

Shows how all six specs connect — from cross-compilation through packaging,
checksums, install scripts, and metadata into the final GitHub Release.

## Shared Conventions

- **Build once, package once** — binaries are compiled exactly once;
  all downstream steps (compress, checksum, publish) reuse the same
  artifacts and must never trigger a rebuild.
- **Pin all tool versions** — never use `@latest` or `@main` for
  CI actions or tool installs. Use exact version tags.
- **Static linking** — use `CGO_ENABLED=0` for Go binaries to produce
  fully static executables with no runtime dependencies.
- **Deterministic builds** — identical source + identical toolchain =
  identical output. Lock dependency versions via lock files.
- **Strict Relative Git Paths Only** — all file paths, markdown links, release notes, changelog entries, manifests, and release documentation MUST strictly use relative Git paths (e.g. `02-spec/...`, `cmd/...`). There is a TOTAL BAN on absolute filesystem paths (`/absolute/...`, `C:\...`) and `file:///` URIs across all release pages, changelogs, and release assets.

## Placeholders

Throughout these documents:

| Placeholder | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| `<binary>` | Your CLI binary name (e.g., `mytool`) |
| `<repo>` | Your repository path (e.g., `github.com/org/repo`) |
| `<version>` | The release version (e.g., `v1.2.0`) |
| `<module>` | Your Go module path |

## Verification

_Auto-generated section — see `02-spec/16-generic-release/97-acceptance-criteria.md` for the full criteria index._

### AC-REL-001: Generic-release conformance: Index

**Given** Inspect a release artifact bundle for required assets and checksums.
**When** Run the verification command shown below.
**Then** SHA-256 checksums verify; `release-metadata.json` matches the package version; install scripts pin the exact release tag.

**Verification command:**

```bash
python3 linter-scripts/check-spec-cross-links.py --root spec --repo-root .
```

**Expected:** exit 0. Any non-zero exit is a hard fail and blocks merge.
