# Generic CLI Creation Guidelines — Overview

> **/goal** Master and enforce the architectural standards, specifications, and CI/CD validation rules for 13 Generic Cli.
> **/learn** Read the sequentially ordered specification files in this directory, follow the actionable CI/CD checklist, and apply mandatory rules before generating code.

## 🎯 Actionable CI/CD & Agent Checklist

- [ ] `/goal` Read and understand all numbered specifications under `13-generic-cli/`.
- [ ] `/learn` Adhere strictly to `.ai-memory/folder-structure.md` and `.ai-memory/strictly-avoid.md`.
- [ ] `/goal` Verify zero explicit `true` boolean evaluations and no mixed-polarity conditionals.
- [ ] `/learn` Run all local verification linters via `python 03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py`.

. **CRITICAL AI INSTRUCTION:** This `readme.md` file is the primary entry point for this directory. AI agents MUST read this file first before exploring other files in this folder.

## Purpose

This specification is a **complete, self-contained blueprint** for
building production-quality CLI tools. Hand it to any AI assistant
or developer and they can implement a well-structured CLI from scratch.

These guidelines are language-agnostic in principle but use Go for
concrete examples. Adapt syntax to your target language.

## Design Philosophy

| Principle | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Consistency over cleverness | Predictable patterns across all commands |
| Convention over configuration | Sensible defaults; config is optional |
| Fail fast, fail clearly | Bad input → immediate error with actionable message |
| One responsibility per unit | Each file, function, and package does one thing |
| No magic strings | Every literal in a constants package |
| Self-documenting | Help text, version, and examples built into the binary |

## How to Use This Spec

1. **Start with `13-checklist.md`** — it gives a sequenced plan.
2. **Reference individual docs** as you implement each layer.
3. **Every code example is a pattern** — adapt names, not structure.
4. **All constraints are mandatory** unless explicitly marked optional.

## Verification

_Auto-generated section — see `02-spec/13-generic-cli/97-acceptance-criteria.md` for the full criteria index._

### AC-CLI-001: Generic CLI conformance: Index

**Given** Run the CLI smoke harness against the documented subcommand surface.
**When** Run the verification command shown below.
**Then** `--help` exits 0 for every subcommand; flags follow kebab-case; structured output is valid JSON when `--json` is set.

**Verification command:**

```bash
go run linter-scripts/validate-guidelines.go --path spec --max-lines 15
```

**Expected:** exit 0. Any non-zero exit is a hard fail and blocks merge.
