# Update — Overview

> **/goal** Master and enforce the architectural standards, specifications, and CI/CD validation rules for 14 Update.
> **/learn** Read the sequentially ordered specification files in this directory, follow the actionable CI/CD checklist, and apply mandatory rules before generating code.

## 🎯 Actionable CI/CD & Agent Checklist

- [ ] `/goal` Read and understand all numbered specifications under `14-update/`.
- [ ] `/learn` Adhere strictly to `.ai-memory/folder-structure.md` and `.ai-memory/strictly-avoid.md`.
- [ ] `/goal` Verify zero explicit `true` boolean evaluations and no mixed-polarity conditionals.
- [ ] `/learn` Run all local verification linters via `python 03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py`.

## Purpose

Single source of truth for the **CLI update mechanism** used across
all Go CLI tools in the Riseup Asia stack. Covers the full lifecycle:
release production → install → version probing → self-update →
rename-first deploy → handoff → verification → cleanup.

This folder consolidates all update-related specs (formerly split across
`14-generic-update/` and `15-self-update-app-update/`) into a single source
of truth. Do not re-split.

Any CLI that ships an `install` or `update` (or `self-update`)
subcommand MUST follow the contracts in this folder.

## Architecture (One-Liner)

```
release  →  install (probe → download → verify → deploy)
         →  run binary
         →  binary checks for update (latest.json)
         →  download → verify checksum → rename current bin
         →  write new bin to canonical deploy path
         →  exec new bin (handoff) → verify → cleanup → done
```

The defining property: **the running binary is renamed, never
deleted, before the new one is written.** This avoids Windows
file-lock errors and guarantees rollback is always one rename away.

## Placement Rules

```
AI INSTRUCTION:

1. ALL update-related content (install, update, self-update,
   release, deploy, cleanup, signing) belongs in this folder.
2. App-specific update behavior (UI prompts, app-side gating)
   goes in 21-app/ instead.
3. Pipeline-side concerns (CI workflow YAML, runner setup) go in
   12-cicd-pipeline-workflows/.
4. Each file follows the standard {NN}-{kebab-case-name}.md naming.
5. Add new files to the File Inventory above and update
   99-consistency-report.md.
6. Numbered ranges:
     01–08  Core mechanism
     09–12  Verification & metadata
     13–23  Release & install
     24+    Future additions (do NOT renumber existing files)
```

## Verification

_Auto-generated section — see `02-spec/14-update/97-acceptance-criteria.md` for the full criteria index._

### AC-UPD-001: Self-update conformance: Index

**Given** Exercise the rename-first deploy path against a fixture release directory.
**When** Run the verification command shown below.
**Then** `latest.json` is written atomically; the old binary is renamed (not deleted) before the new one is moved into place; rollback restores the previous version.

**Verification command:**

```bash
python3 linter-scripts/check-spec-cross-links.py --root spec --repo-root .
```

**Expected:** exit 0. Any non-zero exit is a hard fail and blocks merge.
