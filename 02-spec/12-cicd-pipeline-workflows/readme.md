# CI/CD Pipeline Workflows

> **/goal** Master and enforce the architectural standards, specifications, and CI/CD validation rules for CI/CD Pipeline Workflows.
> **/learn** Read the sequentially ordered specification files in this directory, follow the actionable CI/CD checklist, and apply mandatory rules before generating code.

## 🎯 Actionable CI/CD & Agent Checklist

1. [ ] `/goal` Read and understand all numbered specifications under `12-cicd-pipeline-workflows/`.
2. [ ] `/learn` Adhere strictly to `.ai-memory/folder-structure.md` and `.ai-memory/strictly-avoid.md`.
3. [ ] `/goal` Verify zero explicit `true` boolean evaluations and no mixed-polarity conditionals.
4. [ ] `/learn` Run all local verification linters via `python 03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py`.

**Version:** 4.1.0
**Updated:** 2026-08-30
**AI Confidence:** Production-Ready
**Ambiguity:** None

## Purpose

Central location for all CI/CD pipeline specifications, deployment automation, and related infrastructure-as-code documentation. All pipeline-related content — build pipelines, deployment workflows, environment promotion strategies, and CI/CD tooling configurations — MUST be documented in this folder.

---

## Scope

This module covers two distinct pipeline archetypes, shared conventions, reusable quality guards, and cross-cutting concerns:

| Archetype | Subfolder | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Browser Extension Deploy | `01-browser-extension-deploy/` | Node.js/pnpm multi-component builds, zip packaging, Chrome Web Store |
| Go Binary Deploy | `02-go-binary-deploy/` | Cross-compiled Go binaries, tar.gz/zip, install scripts, code signing |
| Reusable CI Guards | `03-reusable-ci-guards/` | 13 language-agnostic baseline diff gating and quality guards |
| Shared Conventions | Root files | Common patterns used across all pipeline types |

## Verification

_Auto-generated section — see `02-spec/12-cicd-pipeline-workflows/97-acceptance-criteria.md` for the full criteria index._

### AC-CI-001: CI/CD pipeline conformance: Index

**Given** Validate `.github/workflows/*.yml` against the documented job matrix.
**When** Run the verification command shown below.
**Then** Required jobs (`lint`, `cross-links`, `sync-drift`) are present; concurrency groups follow the `<workflow>-<ref>` pattern; `permissions:` is least-privilege.

**Verification command:**

```bash
npm run sync && npm run lint && npm run test
```

**Expected:** exit 0. Any non-zero exit is a hard fail and blocks merge.
