# Terminal Output Standards

## Overview

This document defines the terminal output conventions for all CLI commands, installers, and CI pipeline output. Consistent terminal output ensures a professional user experience and makes output machine-parseable when needed.

---

## Output Formatting Rules

### Indentation

All CLI output uses **2-space indentation** from the left margin:

```
  Scanning repositories...
  Found 42 repositories in ~/projects
  Done.
```

Never use tabs. Never start output at column 0 (except for `version` command and machine-readable output).

### Status Icons

| Icon | Meaning | Usage |
|------|---------|-------|
| `[OK]` | Success/check passed | Doctor checks, verification |
| `[FAIL]` | Failure/check failed | Doctor checks, verification |
| `[WARN]` | Warning (non-fatal) | Deprecation, stdlib vulns |
| `[+]` | Added/registered | PATH registration, env set |
| `[-]` | Removed/unregistered | PATH removal, env remove |
| `[=]` | No change (already exists) | Idempotent operations |
| `[SKIP]` | Skipped (intentionally) | Already installed, cached |

**Note on Unicode**: Use ASCII-only icons (`[OK]`, `[+]`) for generated scripts and CI output. Unicode icons (`✓`, `✗`, `→`) are permitted in Go-compiled binaries only, where UTF-8 encoding is guaranteed.

### Progress Indicators

For operations with multiple steps:

```
  Scanning repositories...

  [1/4] Discovering .git directories
  [2/4] Reading commit metadata
  [3/4] Detecting project types
  [4/4] Writing database

  Done. Scanned 42 repositories in 3.2s.
```

### Error Output

Errors go to stderr with a consistent format:

```
  Error: <what failed> (<reason>)
```

With structured context for debugging:

```
  Error: Failed to open database at /path/to/db.sqlite
    Reason: file is locked by another process
    Operation: store.Open
    Suggestion: Close other instances of <tool> and retry
```

### Tables

Use fixed-width columns with header separators:

```
  NAME           PATH                    BRANCHES    LAST COMMIT
  my-project     ~/projects/my-project   5           2h ago
  other-repo     ~/projects/other-repo   3           1d ago
```

Right-align numeric columns. Left-align text columns.

## Constraints

- 2-space indentation for all human-readable output
- ASCII-only icons in generated scripts; Unicode OK in compiled Go binaries
- Errors to stderr, success output to stdout
- `version` command: single line, no prefix, no indentation
- Tables: left-align text, right-align numbers
- Progress: `[N/M]` format for multi-step operations
- Time durations: use `Xs`, `Xm`, or human-relative (`2h ago`, `1d ago`)
- Empty lines before and after major sections for readability
- No color codes unless Virtual Terminal Processing is confirmed
- All status messages end with a period or specific value (never ellipsis-only)
