# Release Pipeline

> 🔴 **READ BEFORE EDITING:** [`17-release-pipeline-issues-rca.md`](./17-release-pipeline-issues-rca.md) — Root-cause-analysis ledger of every CI/CD failure encountered in this repo (npm ci lockfile drift, pip cache missing manifest, Node-dependent release script). It defines standing rules and a pre-flight checklist that all workflow edits must satisfy.
>
> 📘 **Generic contract this pipeline implements:** [`../16-generic-release/readme.md`](../16-generic-release/readme.md) — tool-agnostic release blueprint (cross-compilation, install scripts, checksums, assets, metadata, known issues). This pipeline is the concrete realization for this repo; behavior MUST stay consistent with that spec.
>
> 📎 **Generic-CLI contracts that bind this pipeline:** [`../13-generic-cli/20-terminal-output-design.md`](../13-generic-cli/20-terminal-output-design.md) (terminal report + color tokens used by install scripts and `doctor`) and [`../13-generic-cli/21-post-install-shell-activation.md`](../13-generic-cli/21-post-install-shell-activation.md) (post-install PATH/profile/wrapper activation, `doctor` LOADED state). Install-script and setup output produced by this pipeline MUST conform to both.

## Overview

The release pipeline automates binary production, packaging, and GitHub Release creation whenever code is pushed to a `release/**` branch or a `v*` tag. It produces cross-compiled binaries for two tools, platform-specific install scripts, checksums, and a fully formatted release page.

---

## Trigger and Concurrency

### Trigger

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - "release/**"
    tags:
      - "v*"
```

### Concurrency

Release pipelines **never cancel** in-progress runs — every release commit must produce complete artifacts:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: release-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: false
```

### Permissions

The workflow needs write access to create GitHub Releases:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
```

---

## Version Resolution

The version is extracted from the Git ref:

- **Tags** (`refs/tags/v1.2.3`): use the tag name directly
- **Branches** (`refs/heads/release/v1.2.3`): strip the `release/` prefix

```bash
if [[ "$GITHUB_REF" == refs/tags/* ]]; then
  VERSION="${GITHUB_REF_NAME}"
elif [[ "$GITHUB_REF" == refs/heads/release/* ]]; then
  VERSION="${GITHUB_REF_NAME#release/}"
fi
```

---

## Binary Building

### Targets

Build for 6 platform/architecture combinations:

| Platform | Architecture | Extension |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Windows | amd64 | `.exe` |
| Windows | arm64 | `.exe` |
| Linux | amd64 | (none) |
| Linux | arm64 | (none) |
| macOS | amd64 | (none) |
| macOS | arm64 | (none) |

### Build Command

```bash
VERSION="<resolved-version>"
LDFLAGS="-s -w -X '<module>/constants.Version=$VERSION'"
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS="$os" GOARCH="$arch" go build -ldflags "$LDFLAGS" -o "dist/<binary>-${VERSION}-${os}-${arch}${ext}" .
```

### Multiple Binaries

If the project produces multiple binaries (e.g., a main tool and an updater), build each from its own module directory. All outputs go into a single `dist/` folder for unified packaging.

---

## Docs-Site Bundling

If the project includes a documentation site (e.g., React/Vite), the release pipeline builds and bundles it as a release asset so the CLI can serve it locally.

> ⚠️ **Repo-specific override:** This generic spec shows `npm ci` as the install step. **In this repo, `npm ci` is forbidden in CI** — see [RCA Issue #1](./17-release-pipeline-issues-rca.md#issue-1--npm-ci-fails-lockfile-out-of-sync). The lockfile is not maintained in sync with `package.json`, so docs-site bundling (if ever enabled here) must use `npm install --no-audit --no-fund` or be performed outside CI and committed as a pre-built artifact.

### Build Step

```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: 22

- name: Build docs-site
  run: |
    npm ci   # ❌ DO NOT USE in this repo — see RCA Issue #1
    npm run build
    cd dist
    zip -r ../dist-output/docs-site.zip .
```

### How It Fits

1. Runs **after** binary compilation but **before** compression/checksums
2. Produces `docs-site.zip` in the `dist/` folder alongside binaries
3. The checksum step covers `docs-site.zip` automatically (it checksums all files in `dist/`)
4. Ships as a standard release asset via `softprops/action-gh-release`

### Install Script Integration

Both install scripts download `docs-site.zip` from the release and extract it next to the binary:

```
<install-dir>/
  <binary>
  docs-site/
    dist/
      index.html
      assets/
        ...
```

The CLI's `help-dashboard` command auto-extracts `docs-site.zip` on first run if the `docs-site/` directory is missing, so the docs work out of the box even if the installer skipped extraction.

### Graceful Fallback

- If the docs-site build fails, the release should still succeed — `docs-site.zip` is optional
- Install scripts treat download failure as non-fatal (print a skip message, continue)
- The CLI falls back to `npm run dev` if no static `dist/` is found

---

## Compression and Checksums

### Compression Rules

| Platform | Format | Command |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Windows | `.zip` | `zip "${name}.zip" "$file"` |
| Linux, macOS | `.tar.gz` | `tar czf "${name}.tar.gz" "$file"` |

After compression, remove the raw binaries — only archives ship as release assets.

### Checksums

Generate SHA-256 checksums for all files in the dist directory:

```bash
sha256sum * > checksums.txt
```

The `checksums.txt` file is included as a release asset for verification.

---

## Install Scripts

The pipeline generates version-pinned install scripts using placeholder substitution. Scripts are written inline in the workflow with `VERSION_PLACEHOLDER` and `REPO_PLACEHOLDER` tokens, then `sed` replaces them:

```bash
sed -i "s|VERSION_PLACEHOLDER|$VERSION|g" dist/install.ps1
sed -i "s|REPO_PLACEHOLDER|$REPO|g" dist/install.ps1
chmod +x dist/install.sh
```

### PowerShell Installer (`install.ps1`)

Features:

- Auto-detect CPU architecture (amd64/arm64)
- Download versioned `.zip` from GitHub Releases
- Verify SHA-256 checksum against `checksums.txt`
- Rename-first upgrade strategy (move existing binary to `.old` before replacing)
- Extract binary from zip archive
- Add install directory to user `PATH` via Windows registry

### Bash Installer (`install.sh`)

Features:

- Auto-detect OS (`linux`/`darwin`) and architecture (`amd64`/`arm64`)
- Download versioned `.tar.gz` from GitHub Releases
- Verify SHA-256 checksum (`sha256sum` or `shasum -a 256` fallback)
- Rename-first upgrade strategy
- Shell-aware PATH configuration (bash → `.bashrc`, zsh → `.zshrc`, fish → `config.fish`)
- Support `curl` or `wget` for downloads
- CLI flags: `--version`, `--dir`, `--arch`, `--no-path`

### Common Install Script Patterns

Both scripts follow the same flow:

```
1. Detect platform and architecture
2. Download binary archive + checksums.txt
3. Verify checksum (fail on mismatch)
4. Rename existing binary to .old (if upgrading)
5. Extract and install new binary
6. Clean up .old file
7. Add to PATH (if not already present)
8. Print installed version
```

---

## Changelog Extraction

Extract the matching version section from `changelog.md` using `awk`:

```bash
awk -v ver="$VERSION" '
  /^## / {
    if (found) exit
    if (index($0, ver)) found=1
  }
  found { print }
' changelog.md
```

Falls back to a "No changelog entry found" message if the version section doesn't exist.

---

## Release Body

The GitHub Release description is assembled from multiple sources:

1. **Changelog entry** — extracted from `changelog.md`
2. **Release info table** — version, commit SHA (truncated), branch, build date, Go version
3. **Checksums block** — full `checksums.txt` in a code fence
4. **Install instructions** — quick install one-liners for PowerShell and Bash, plus version-pinned alternatives
5. **Asset matrix** — table mapping platform/architecture to filenames

### Release Type Detection

| Condition | Release Type | `prerelease` | `make_latest` |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| Version contains `-` (e.g., `v1.0.0-beta.1`) | Pre-release | `true` | `false` |
| Version is clean (e.g., `v1.0.0`) | Stable | `false` | `true` |

---

## GitHub Release Creation

```yaml
- uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v2
  with:
    tag_name: ${{ steps.version.outputs.version }}
    name: ${{ steps.version.outputs.version }}
    body_path: /tmp/release-body.md
    files: dist/*
    draft: false
    prerelease: ${{ contains(steps.version.outputs.version, '-') }}
    make_latest: ${{ !contains(steps.version.outputs.version, '-') }}
```

---

## AI Release Synchronization Protocol

When an AI Agent or automated system handles a release, it MUST synchronously update all canonical version strings across the codebase *before* pushing any Git tag.

### Mandatory Pre-Release Step Sequence

1. **Update `version.json` (Source of Truth):**
   ```json
   {
     "version": "X.Y.Z"
   }
   ```
2. **Update Web & Changelog Metadata:**
   Inject the `## [vX.Y.Z] YYYY-MM-DD` block into `changelog.md` and update `package.json`.
3. **Commit & Push to Branch First:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore(release): bump version to vX.Y.Z"
   git push origin main
   ```
4. **Tag Execution (Only after branch push is verified):**
   ```bash
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

### 🎯 Actionable CI/CD & Agent Checklist

1. [ ] `/goal` Verify version consistency between `version.json` and `package.json`.
2. [ ] `/learn` Read `.ai-memory/folder-structure.md` and `02-spec/12-cicd-pipeline-workflows/03-shared-conventions.md` to follow version resolution rules.
3. [ ] `/goal` Verify branch changes are committed and pushed to remote before pushing tags.
4. [ ] `/learn` Read `02-spec/12-cicd-pipeline-workflows/17-release-pipeline-issues-rca.md` Issue #13 to prevent release skew.
5. [ ] `/learn` Run verification via `python 03-ai-scripts/06-cicd-local-runner.py`.

## Constraints

- **Build once, package once** — binaries are compiled exactly once; compression, checksums, and publishing operate on the already-built artifacts and must never trigger a rebuild
- Every release commit must run to completion — never cancel release pipelines
- Version is resolved from the Git ref, never hardcoded (see RCA Issue #3 — no `node` runtime allowed for version reads)
- All binaries are statically linked (`CGO_ENABLED=0`)
- Checksums are generated for all release assets
- Install scripts use placeholder substitution, not string interpolation
- Install scripts implement rename-first upgrades (never delete-then-write)
- Pre-release vs. stable is determined automatically from the version string
- 🔴 **No `npm ci`, no `actions/setup-node`, no built-in language caches** — see RCA Issues #1, #2, #3

### Why these Generic-CLI specs matter at release time

- **`20-terminal-output-design.md`** — defines the ASCII-only, color-tagged report format every binary must emit. Release packaging MUST NOT strip color codes or rewrap report tables, and install-script success/failure banners MUST follow the same color/severity tokens so users see one consistent visual language from `install.sh` through `<tool> doctor`.
- **`21-post-install-shell-activation.md`** — the release pipeline's install scripts and the binary's `setup` subcommand jointly own the post-install activation contract (PATH export, profile snippet injection, in-session activation, `doctor` LOADED/INSTALLED_BUT_NOT_LOADED/NOT_INSTALLED states). Any change to install scripts, setup output, or doctor checks in this pipeline MUST conform to that spec to prevent the "binary on PATH but wrapper not loaded" class of post-release bugs.
