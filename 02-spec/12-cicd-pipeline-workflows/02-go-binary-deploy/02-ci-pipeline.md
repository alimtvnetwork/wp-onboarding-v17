# Go Binary — CI Pipeline

**Version:** 3.2.0
**Updated:** 2026-04-16

---

## Overview

The CI pipeline validates every push and pull request to the `main` branch. It runs linting, vulnerability scanning, parallel test suites, and cross-compiled builds — then caches the result so identical commits are never re-validated.

---

## Trigger and Concurrency

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

concurrency:
  group: ci-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: ${{ !startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/heads/release/') }}
```

---

## Job Graph

```
sha-check ──┬── lint ──────┬── test (matrix: N suites) ──┬── test-summary ── build (matrix: 6 targets) ── build-summary
             │              │                              │
             └── vulncheck ─┘                              └── (cache SHA on success)
```

All jobs depend on `sha-check`. If the SHA is already cached, every job prints a skip message and exits successfully — no work is repeated.

---

## Pattern: SHA-Based Build Deduplication (Passthrough Gate)

### Problem

Re-running the pipeline on an already-validated commit wastes compute and blocks PRs with slow re-checks.

### Solution

A gate job probes the GitHub Actions cache for a key tied to the commit SHA. Downstream jobs always run (never `if: false` at job level) but use **step-level conditionals** to skip expensive work when the SHA is cached.

### Why Not Job-Level `if`?

GitHub treats skipped jobs as neither success nor failure. Required status checks see "skipped" as not passing — this blocks merges and shows grey icons in the UI. The passthrough pattern ensures every job shows a green checkmark.

### Implementation

**Step 1 — Gate job** outputs whether the SHA was found:

```yaml
sha-check:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  outputs:
    already-built: ${{ steps.cache-check.outputs.cache-hit }}
  steps:
    - name: Check SHA cache
      id: cache-check
      uses: actions/cache@v4
      with:
        path: /tmp/ci-passed
        key: ci-passed-${{ github.sha }}
        lookup-only: true
```

**Step 2 — Every downstream step** uses a conditional:

```yaml
- name: Already validated
  if: needs.sha-check.outputs.already-built == 'true'
  run: echo "✅ SHA ${{ github.sha }} already passed"

- uses: actions/checkout@v6
  if: needs.sha-check.outputs.already-built != 'true'

# ... all remaining steps guard with the same condition

```

**Step 3 — Cache write is inlined** into the last validation job (not a separate job):

```yaml
- name: Mark SHA as built
  if: success() && needs.sha-check.outputs.already-built != 'true'
  run: mkdir -p /tmp/ci-passed && echo "${{ github.sha }}" > /tmp/ci-passed/sha.txt

- name: Save SHA to cache
  if: success() && needs.sha-check.outputs.already-built != 'true'
  uses: actions/cache/save@v4
  with:
    path: /tmp/ci-passed
    key: ci-passed-${{ github.sha }}
```

**Why inline the cache write?** A separate `mark-success` job could be canceled by `cancel-in-progress` after all validation jobs pass but before the cache is saved. Inlining it into the final validation step prevents this race condition.

---

## Job: Lint

Runs static analysis using `go vet` and `golangci-lint`.

### Steps

1. Checkout repository
2. Setup Go toolchain (version from `go.mod`)
3. Run `go vet ./...`
4. Run `golangci-lint` (pinned version, 5-minute timeout)

### Tool Configuration

```yaml
- uses: golangci/golangci-lint-action@v6
  with:
    version: v1.64.8
    working-directory: <module-root>
    args: --timeout=5m
```

- `golangci-lint` is configured via `.golangci.yml` in the project root
- Version is pinned — never use `@latest`
- The action handles caching automatically
- Use `working-directory` to point at the Go module root

---

## Job: Vulnerability Scan (In-CI)

See [Vulnerability Scanning](../06-vulnerability-scanning.md) for full details.

Runs `govulncheck` with third-party vs. stdlib differentiation:

- Third-party vulnerabilities → **fail the build**
- Standard library vulnerabilities → **warn only**

---

## Job: Test (Matrix)

Runs tests in parallel across multiple suites using a matrix strategy.

### Matrix Definition

```yaml
strategy:
  fail-fast: false
  matrix:
    include:
      - name: unit
        packages: ./pkg1/... ./pkg2/...
      - name: store
        packages: ./tests/store_test/...
      - name: integration
        packages: ./tests/integration_test/...
      - name: tui
        packages: ./tui/...
```

**Why `fail-fast: false`?** All suites run to completion even if one fails. This gives a complete picture of what is broken, not just the first failure.

### Test Execution

```bash
set -uo pipefail
set +e
go test ${{ matrix.packages }} -v -count=1 \
  -coverprofile=coverage-${{ matrix.name }}.out \
  -covermode=atomic 2>&1 | tee test-output.txt
exit_code=${PIPESTATUS[0]}
set -e

if [ "$exit_code" -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "========================================="
  echo " FAILED TESTS (${{ matrix.name }})"
  echo "========================================="
  grep -E -A 5 '^--- FAIL:' test-output.txt || true
  echo "========================================="
fi

exit "$exit_code"
```

Key details:

- `set +e` prevents the step from exiting on the first test failure — capture the exit code instead
- `tee` writes output to both stdout and a file for artifact upload
- `PIPESTATUS[0]` captures the exit code of `go test`, not `tee`
- `-count=1` disables test caching for reliable CI results
- `-covermode=atomic` enables safe concurrent coverage collection

### Zero-Storage Test Reporting

Emit test results directly to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` without consuming storage:

```yaml
- name: Publish test summary
  if: always()
  run: |
    echo "### Test Results: ${{ matrix.name }}" >> "$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY"
    tail -n 20 test-output.txt >> "$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY"
```

---

## Job: Test Summary

Aggregates results from all test matrix jobs into a single report.

### Failure Report

A script parses each suite's `test-output.txt` to extract:

- Failing test names
- Specific failure reasons (assertion errors, expected/got mismatches, panics, undefined references)

It produces a **"FAILURE REPORT (copy-paste ready)"** block — a self-contained summary that can be shared directly without scrolling through full CI logs.

### Coverage Aggregation

After failure reporting, merge all coverage profiles:

1. Concatenate all `coverage-*.out` files (stripping duplicate `mode:` headers)
2. Run `go tool cover -func=combined-coverage.out`
3. Use `awk` to calculate per-package average coverage
4. Print a formatted table with package paths and percentages

### Cache Write

The SHA cache is saved as the **final step** of `test-summary` (only on success). See the SHA deduplication pattern above for why this is inlined.

---

## Job: Build (Matrix)

Cross-compiles binaries for all target platforms after tests pass.

### Matrix Definition

```yaml
strategy:
  fail-fast: false
  matrix:
    include:
      - { os: windows, arch: amd64, ext: .exe }
      - { os: windows, arch: arm64, ext: .exe }
      - { os: linux, arch: amd64, ext: "" }
      - { os: linux, arch: arm64, ext: "" }
      - { os: darwin, arch: amd64, ext: "" }
      - { os: darwin, arch: arm64, ext: "" }
```

### Build Command

```bash
VERSION="dev-${GITHUB_SHA::10}"
LDFLAGS="-s -w -X '<module>/constants.Version=$VERSION'"
OUTPUT="<binary>-${VERSION}-${{ matrix.os }}-${{ matrix.arch }}${{ matrix.ext }}"
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=${{ matrix.os }} GOARCH=${{ matrix.arch }} go build -ldflags "$LDFLAGS" -o "$OUTPUT" .
```

Key details:

- `CGO_ENABLED=0` produces static binaries with no C dependencies
- `-s -w` strips debug symbols for smaller binaries
- `-X` embeds the version string at compile time
- CI builds use `dev-<sha>` versioning; release builds use semantic versions

---

## Job: Build Summary

Downloads all build artifacts and prints a formatted table of binary names and file sizes:

```bash
printf " %-45s %s\n" "Binary" "Size"
for dir in binaries/*; do
  for file in "$dir"/*; do
    name=$(basename "$file")
    size=$(stat --format="%s" "$file")
    human=$(numfmt --to=iec --suffix=B "$size")
    printf " %-45s %s\n" "$name" "$human"
  done
done
```

---

## Constraints

- No `cd` in CI steps — use `working-directory`
- All tool installs use exact version tags — `@latest` is prohibited
- Validate build output directories before operating: `test -d "$DIR" || exit 1`
- Never use job-level `if` for SHA deduplication — use step-level conditionals
- Inline cache writes into the last validation job — never a separate job
- `fail-fast: false` on all matrix strategies
