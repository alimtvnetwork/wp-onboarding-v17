## Purpose

Pipeline specifications for building, testing, and releasing cross-compiled Go binaries. These pipelines handle static compilation for 6 platform/architecture targets, SHA-based build deduplication, platform-specific install scripts, and code signing.

## Key Characteristics

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Language | Go |
| Build Mode | Static linking (`CGO_ENABLED=0`) |
| Targets | 6 platforms (windows/linux/darwin × amd64/arm64) |
| Compression | `.zip` (Windows), `.tar.gz` (Linux/macOS) |
| Distribution | GitHub Releases + install scripts |
| Version Embedding | `-ldflags -X` at compile time |

---

## Pipeline Architecture

```
CI Pipeline:
  sha-check → [lint, vulncheck] → test (matrix: N suites) → test-summary → build (matrix: 6 targets) → build-summary

Release Pipeline:
  setup (version) → build all binaries → compress → checksums → install scripts → changelog → GitHub Release
```

The CI pipeline uses a **SHA-based passthrough gate** to skip redundant validation of already-tested commits.
