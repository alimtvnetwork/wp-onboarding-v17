## Purpose

Pipeline specifications for building, testing, and releasing browser extensions (Chrome/Chromium) built with Node.js and a package manager (pnpm/npm). These pipelines handle multi-component dependency graphs where an SDK must be built before dependent modules, and all modules must be assembled into a final extension package.

---

## Key Characteristics

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Language | TypeScript / JavaScript |
| Package Manager | pnpm (or npm) |
| Build Tool | Vite, Webpack, or similar bundler |
| Output | `.zip` archive of extension `dist/` contents |
| Distribution | GitHub Releases, Chrome Web Store (manual upload) |

---

## Pipeline Architecture

```
CI Pipeline:
  setup (lint + test) → build-sdk → [build-module-A, build-module-B, build-module-C] → build-extension

Release Pipeline:
  setup (lint + test + version) → build-sdk → [build-modules...] → build-extension → package → release
```

The build graph has a **diamond dependency**: the SDK is built first, then multiple standalone modules build in parallel (each downloading the SDK artifact), then the final extension build assembles everything.
